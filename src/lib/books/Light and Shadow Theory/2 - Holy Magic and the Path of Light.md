## What Holy Magic Is

Holy magic is Light magic granted by Luminance to faithful worshipers. The power originates from Luminance, flows through the practitioner's devotion, and emerges as concentrated light.

Brother Matthias describes the experience: "When I channel Luminance's gift, I feel light itself responding to prayer. Not heat, not magical energy. Pure light, guided by faith and will."

Holy light heals humans and fellow practitioners. The same light burns vampiric beings and supernatural creatures. The magic itself discriminates. Matthias reports this as fundamental to Luminance's nature. "The light serves humanity. It recognizes those who walk in Luminance's grace and those who exist outside it. I don't choose whether my magic heals or harms. The light chooses."

A practitioner channeling healing light toward allies simultaneously creates deadly force against vampiric enemies in the same area.
## Faith as Foundation

Holy magic cannot be learned through study. Faith is the conduit, devotion the requirement, prayer the practice. The scriptures state: "Let the faithful call upon the Light, and the Light shall answer. Let the faithless speak, and only silence greets them."

Matthias explains: "I spent years in worship before Luminance granted me this gift. Not studying theory. Not practicing techniques. Praying. Serving. Only then did the light respond."

Luminance grants power to those whose devotion is real. Many spend entire lives in faithful worship without receiving magical gifts. Those who receive Holy magic treat it as blessing rather than earned skill.

Prayer functions as the channeling mechanism. Where other practitioners focus magical energy through technique, Holy magic practitioners focus divine power through directed prayer. "I speak to Luminance. I request the light. The words matter less than the connection behind them."

Loss of faith means loss of power. Apostasy removes access to Holy magic. Matthias reports knowing practitioners who lost their gifts through spiritual crisis. "The light simply stopped responding. Luminance withdrew the blessing."

The church cannot restore lost gifts. Practitioners must rebuild that relationship entirely.
## Manifestations of Light

Some manifest holy magic as beams of light descending from above. Matthias describes these as "Luminance's direct touch reaching through to our realm." Others focus the light into spherical shapes and direct them towards targets.

These manifestations heal or smite depending on the target. When directed toward humans, the light mends wounds and purifies corruption. When striking vampiric beings, the same light burns with concentrated force.

Some observers confuse Holy magic with storm magic due to visual similarity. Both can call down strikes from the sky. Storm magic manipulates magical energy. Holy magic is pure light, divine power manifested as illumination.

Matthias can summon holy foci, physical manifestations that channel Luminance's power across wider areas. "I pray for Luminance to establish a beacon. Light manifests as a focus, sustained through continued faith. Other practitioners can channel through it."

These foci appear as brilliant points of light, anchored in physical space. Multiple foci create networks of light, extending Holy magic's range beyond individual capability.
## Movement Through Light

Some practitioners can move through light as instantaneous displacement. This isn't traditional teleportation. Matthias explains: "I don't fold space. I ask Luminance to move me through the light itself. I transition from one point of illumination to another."

The technique requires absolute faith. Doubt during transition causes failure.
## Theological Questions

Where does the light itself originate? Religious texts present Luminance as divine entity who grants power to faithful. Some scholars propose a Realm of Light exists, parallel to the Shadow Realm. Perhaps Luminance channels power from a corresponding realm.

Matthias finds this incomplete: "If Luminance merely channels power, then my deity serves as intermediary. But my faith tells me Luminance is the source itself."

The counterargument: perhaps Luminance rules the Realm of Light as a Shadow deity might rule the Shadow Realm. This preserves Luminance's divine status while explaining the light's origin through planar theory.

The Shadow Realm can be verified through the rift in Mortium. A Realm of Light has no known physical access point. The scriptures offer guidance: "The Light comes from Light Eternal. Seek not the path, but the truth of illumination."

Matthias: "Whether Luminance channels power from a realm or generates it divinely matters less than the truth I experience. The light responds to faith. That relationship defines Holy magic."
## Origins and Current State
Historical accounts suggest Holy magic emerged during Dracula's conquest. As Shadow magic devastated Vardoran, desperate humans prayed into the cosmos for salvation. Luminance answered. The first practitioners received their gifts approximately fifty years ago, coinciding with humanity's greatest need.

Some scholars theorize Luminance and Holy magic existed long before this crisis. Perhaps scattered worship of Luminance occurred throughout history, with occasional practitioners receiving minor blessings. The theory proposes that humanity's collective desperation during Dracula's conquest caused a surge in divine response. Mass prayer met with mass granting of power. What was once rare became widespread.

Matthias acknowledges the uncertainty: "I cannot say whether Luminance is ancient or newly manifested. What I know is this: when humanity cried out against darkness, the Light answered. Whether that was first response or simply the greatest response, the result remains. We received the power to fight back."

The victory against Dracula validated this divine intervention. The war demonstrated Light's power against Shadow. In the decades since, the church has grown significantly. New practitioners continue earning Luminance's blessing, though not in the desperate numbers seen during the war itself.

The early practitioners discovered Holy magic's dual nature through necessity. Light that heals can also smite. The scriptures acknowledge this: "Let the Light mend the faithful and burn the wicked, for both are expressions of divine will."

Holy magic was forged in combat against Shadow. The church now trains practitioners for both healing service and martial application, recognizing that Light serves humanity by opposing darkness directly when necessary.
