## External Origins

Holy magic and Shadow magic differ fundamentally from the eight traditional schools. Where Chaos, Frost, Blood, and the others manifest from natural magical principles within our realm, Holy and Shadow magic originate from external sources.

Holy magic flows from Luminance, a deity who grants power to faithful worshipers. Shadow magic was stolen from the Shadow Realm by Dracula approximately fifty years ago.

I have no direct experience with either school. Volume 2 addresses Holy magic through consultation with practicing faithful. Volume 3 examines Shadow magic through surviving war accounts.
## Dracula and the Shadow Realm

Historical accounts from Mortium describe Dracula as ambitious but not initially the mightiest of the Tepes clan. The records indicate he ventured farther east than tradition permitted, into lands where even the frost seemed hostile to mortal presence.

War records from Noctum refer to "the blessing of the ancient darkness" and "power from the realm of shadow." Scholarly analysis suggests Dracula discovered a rift to the Shadow Realm, a place described in planar theory texts as a realm of darkness and hunger.

Dracula returned to Mortium changed. He commanded power that the traditional vampire bloodline did not grant. He could channel darkness itself, summon creatures from the Shadow Realm, and wield magic that consumed rather than transformed. This was Shadow magic, stolen from a realm not meant for mortal access.

The rift Dracula opened in Mortium remains active, now controlled by Noctum.
## The Conquest

Dracula used Shadow magic as weapon of conquest. War records document his campaign beginning approximately fifty years ago. His first target: Oakveil Wood north of Mortium. The forest fell to what survivors described as "legions pulled from living darkness" and magic that corrupted the land itself. The witches who defended Oakveil were slaughtered. What remains is the Cursed Forest, permanently scarred by that battle.

After Oakveil, Dracula turned north to Balaton. Records indicate he didn't conquer Balaton. He annihilated it. Nothing remains of that kingdom except fragmented accounts of "golden roads and waterfalls of jewels" and scattered refugees. The systematic destruction suggests Shadow magic scales beyond individual combat into landscape-altering devastation.

Each conquered territory fed his Legion of Noctum. Vampires who resisted fell to his draculin summons. Mortals were conscripted or consumed. Shadow magic provided endless reinforcement through the Shadow Realm rift, creatures that felt no pain and feared no death.

The campaign lasted several years before Luminance intervened. Dracula's conquest extended beyond Vardoran's borders, threatening multiple nations in rapid succession.
## Luminance's Intervention

Religious texts from Luminance worship describe the deity as a source of Light opposing the Shadow Realm's darkness. Where Shadow consumes and conceals, Light reveals and purifies.

According to church records and war accounts, Luminance responded to Dracula's conquest when he returned to Vardoran. The texts refer to "the Great Blade of Luminance" but accounts differ on whether this was Luminance directly manifesting or a champion blessed with Holy magic.

The battle occurred at sunrise. Dracula, weakened by extended campaign and the rising sun, faced power he couldn't simply consume. Holy and Shadow magic collided. War accounts describe an explosion of opposing forces so violent it left permanent scarring on the land.

Dracula's physical body was destroyed. Whether this constitutes true death for an immortal of his power remains debated. His Legion fractured immediately. Without their king, Noctum splintered into competing factions. The conquest ended approximately forty-five years ago.
## Theoretical Symmetry

The asymmetry troubles scholars. Shadow magic demonstrably originates from the Shadow Realm, a place that can be accessed through rifts. Holy magic comes from Luminance, a deity. Why this difference?

Some propose a Realm of Light exists, parallel to the Shadow Realm, and Luminance simply serves as that realm's divine guardian or manifestation. Others suggest a Shadow deity rules the Shadow Realm, undiscovered because none who venture deep enough survive to report it. Perhaps both schools actually derive from deity-ruled realms. Perhaps both actually derive from realms alone, and Luminance is theological interpretation rather than literal entity.

These theories cannot be verified. We know the Shadow Realm exists because the rift remains open and creatures emerge from it. We know Luminance grants power to faithful because practitioners demonstrate Holy magic. Beyond that, the origins blur into theology, planar theory, and speculation.
## Current State

Noctum controls Mortium and the rift to the Shadow Realm. They continue Dracula's work, summoning creatures and conducting experiments with Shadow magic. The knowledge Dracula possessed scattered when he fell.

Holy magic practitioners exist but have declined significantly in the decades since the war. The church maintains presence in Vardoran, though diminished. Brother Matthias, who contributes to Volume 2, represents this continuing tradition.

Shadow magic remains largely inaccessible for study. No practitioners operate openly within Academy reach. The rift is controlled territory.
