## How I Developed This Formula
This formula came from solving personal problem rather than academic inquiry. I'm terrible with horses. They sense my discomfort, I sense their judgment, and everyone involved suffers. When Academy acquired horses for transportation research, I needed solution that didn't involve actually becoming competent rider.

Fire blossom's movement enhancement properties seemed relevant. The plant improves physical performance and movement speed in humans—why not extend that to mounted movement? Initial testing confirmed the theory: consuming fire blossom while mounted somehow transfers enhancement effect to mount-rider coordination.

The mechanism remains unclear. Fire blossom doesn't make horses faster—it makes you better at riding efficiently. Your posture improves, your balance becomes more natural, your commands to mount become clearer. The horse responds to competent rider rather than nervous passenger.

This represents one of few formulations I discovered while trying to compensate for personal inadequacy rather than pursuing theoretical understanding. Sometimes practical necessity drives better innovation than academic curiosity.
## The Formula
**Ingredients:**
- 60 measures fire blossom
- 1 empty glass bottle

**Preparation:**
Grind fire blossom flowers thoroughly. The bright orange petals should become uniform fine powder. Fire blossom's resilient structure requires extended grinding.

Transfer ground material to glass bottle. Add clean water to fill. Seal and shake vigorously for two minutes. Let steep minimum 45 minutes. The potion turns golden-orange and maintains warm feeling even at room temperature. Strain before use.

**Effect:**
One bottle provides 60 minutes enhanced mounted movement speed. You and your mount move approximately 15% faster than baseline. The enhancement affects overall coordination rather than just speed—you ride more efficiently, make better decisions, coordinate better with mount.

Effect persists through death, which proves useful for courier services operating in dangerous territory.
## Practical Uses
Military cavalry units consider this potion standard equipment. Enhanced movement speed provides tactical advantages in mounted combat, allowing faster engagement and disengagement.

Courier services use it for time-sensitive deliveries. The 15% speed increase can mean difference between timely arrival and missed deadlines when covering long distances.

Mounted patrols benefit from extended coverage area. The enhanced speed allows larger territory monitoring in same time period.

Emergency response situations where speed matters—rescue operations, message delivery, rapid troop deployment—all benefit from mounted movement enhancement.

Interestingly, recreational riders report this makes riding more enjoyable. The enhanced coordination apparently reduces rider anxiety and improves horse-rider rapport beyond just speed increase.
## Rider Coordination Theory
The coordination enhancement appears more significant than raw speed increase. Test riders report:

**Improved Balance:** Less effort maintaining seat, more natural weight distribution, better adaptation to mount's movement.

**Clearer Communication:** Commands to mount become more intuitive, horse responds more readily, overall interaction flows more smoothly.

**Reduced Fatigue:** Both rider and mount tire less during extended riding. The efficient coordination apparently reduces wasted energy.

**Better Decision-Making:** Mounted tactical decisions improve—better judgment about when to gallop versus canter, when to slow for obstacles, overall pacing optimization.

These coordination improvements suggest fire blossom enhances neural-physical integration generally, which manifests as better riding when consumed while mounted.
## Development Notes
**Attempt #17:** Tried feeding fire blossom directly to horses thinking they might benefit from movement enhancement. Wrong. Horses showed no performance improvement and seemed mildly annoyed by the food.

**Attempt #24:** Thought combining fire blossom with other movement-related plants might provide additional enhancement. Tested with snow flower, ghost shroom, mourning lily. None improved riding performance beyond fire blossom alone.

**Attempt #31:** Experimented with lower fire blossom concentrations hoping to reduce cost. Found 60 measures minimum effective dose—less provides negligible enhancement barely noticeable in practical use.

**Attempt #38:** Tested whether consuming potion before mounting versus while mounted mattered. Found slight advantage to consuming while already mounted, but difference minimal enough that either works acceptably.
## Important Warnings
This enhances riding skill, not horse capabilities. Don't push mounts beyond their physical limits just because coordination improves. Enhanced riding doesn't prevent mount exhaustion or injury from excessive demands.

The effect requires actual mounting. Drinking potion while on foot provides no movement benefit. You must be mounted for enhancement to manifest.

Don't assume enhanced coordination makes you expert rider. This improves your riding relative to baseline skill—terrible riders become acceptable, acceptable riders become good. It doesn't create master equestrian from complete novice.

Store away from extreme heat despite fire blossom's heat association. The prepared potion's compounds degrade rapidly in hot conditions. Keep at moderate temperature for optimal results.
