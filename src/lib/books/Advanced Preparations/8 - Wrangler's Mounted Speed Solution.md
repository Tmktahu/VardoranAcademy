## How I Developed This Formula
This formula came from solving personal problem rather than academic inquiry. I'm terrible with horses. They sense my discomfort, I sense their judgment, and everyone involved suffers. When Academy acquired horses for transportation research, I needed solution that didn't involve actually becoming competent rider.

Fire blossom's movement enhancement properties seemed relevant. The plant improves physical performance and movement speed in humans; why not extend that to mounted movement? Initial testing confirmed the theory: consuming fire blossom while mounted somehow transfers enhancement effect to mount-rider coordination.

The mechanism remains unclear. Fire blossom doesn't make horses faster. It makes you better at riding efficiently. Your posture improves, your balance becomes more natural, your commands to mount become clearer. The horse responds to competent rider rather than nervous passenger.

This represents one of few formulations I discovered while trying to compensate for personal inadequacy rather than pursuing theoretical understanding. Sometimes practical necessity drives better innovation than academic curiosity.
## The Formula
**Ingredients:**
- 60 measures fire blossom
- 1 empty glass bottle

**Preparation:**
Grind fire blossom flowers thoroughly. The bright orange petals should become uniform fine powder. Fire blossom's resilient structure requires extended grinding.

Transfer ground material to glass bottle. Add clean water to fill. Seal and shake vigorously for two minutes. Let steep minimum 45 minutes. The potion turns golden-orange and maintains warm feeling even at room temperature. Strain before use.

**Effect:**
One bottle provides 1 day enhanced mounted movement speed. You and your mount move noticeably faster than baseline, covering ground more efficiently. The enhancement affects overall rider-horse coordination rather than just speed. You ride more smoothly, make quicker decisions, coordinate better with your mount.

The enhanced movement proves useful for courier services operating in dangerous territory. Rapid delivery without exposing couriers to unnecessary risk remains valuable whether mounted or otherwise incapacitated.
## Practical Uses
Military cavalry units consider this potion standard equipment. Enhanced movement speed provides tactical advantages in mounted combat, allowing faster engagement and disengagement.

Courier services use it for time-sensitive deliveries. The noticeable speed improvement can mean difference between timely arrival and missed deadlines when covering long distances.

Mounted patrols benefit from extended coverage area. The enhanced speed allows larger territory monitoring in same time period.

Emergency response situations where speed matters like rescue operations, message delivery, and rapid troop deployment all benefit from mounted movement enhancement.

Interestingly, recreational riders report this makes riding more enjoyable. The enhanced coordination apparently reduces rider anxiety and improves horse-rider rapport beyond just speed increase.
## Rider Coordination Theory
The coordination enhancement appears more significant than raw speed increase. Test riders report:

**Improved Balance:** Better seat stability while mounted, more natural weight distribution in saddle, smoother adaptation to mount's movement patterns.

**Clearer Communication:** Commands to mount become more intuitive, horse responds more readily to cues, overall rider-horse interaction flows more smoothly.

**Reduced Fatigue:** Both rider and mount tire less during extended riding periods. The efficient rider-horse coordination apparently reduces wasted energy that comes from poor positioning and mistimed commands.

**Better Mounted Decision-Making:** Riding-related decisions improve, which includes better judgment about pacing and gait selection, when to accelerate versus maintain speed, and more precise timing for turns and stops.

These coordination improvements are specific to rider-horse interaction only. Fire blossom enhances your ability to coordinate with a mount while you're actually mounted. The benefits vanish immediately upon dismounting.
## Development Notes
**Attempt #17:** Tried feeding fire blossom directly to horses thinking they might benefit from movement enhancement. Wrong. Horses showed no performance improvement and seemed mildly annoyed by the food.

**Attempt #24:** Thought combining fire blossom with other movement-related plants might provide additional enhancement. Tested with snow flower, ghost shroom, mourning lily. None improved riding performance beyond fire blossom alone.

**Attempt #31:** Experimented with lower fire blossom concentrations hoping to reduce cost. Found 60 measures minimum effective dose, as less provides negligible enhancement barely noticeable in practical use.

**Attempt #38:** Tested whether consuming potion before mounting versus while mounted mattered. Found slight advantage to consuming while already mounted, but difference minimal enough that either works acceptably.
## Important Warnings
This enhances riding skill, not horse capabilities. Don't push mounts beyond their physical limits just because coordination improves. Enhanced riding doesn't prevent mount exhaustion or injury from excessive demands.

The effect requires actual mounting. Drinking potion while on foot provides no movement benefit. You must be mounted for enhancement to manifest.

Coordination benefits are MOUNTED-ONLY. Improved balance, reduced fatigue, better decision-making, and clearer communication apply exclusively to rider-horse interaction while in saddle. No benefits occur while dismounted.

Don't assume enhanced coordination makes you expert rider. This improves your riding relative to baseline skill because terrible riders become acceptable and acceptable riders become good. It doesn't create master equestrian from complete novice.

Store away from extreme heat despite fire blossom's heat association. The prepared potion's compounds degrade rapidly in hot conditions. Keep at moderate temperature for optimal results.
