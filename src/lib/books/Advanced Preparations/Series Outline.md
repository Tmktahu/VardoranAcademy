**Author Notes:**
- These come from Ashen Keep hunters

## TODO List

### High Priority
- [ ] Review Blood Magic series book dates to ensure they are after vampire consultant (Severin) starts working with Academy
- [ ] Update timeline document with this narrative information and all relevant dates
- [ ] Verify Field Alchemy series (or other prior alchemical series) dates are before Advanced Preparations series chronologically
- [ ] Verify all chronological relationships make sense with other Academy history

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Consider adding references to increased monster population throughout earlier volumes to foreshadow
- [ ] Add mentions of Academy security concerns in Volume 5 context
- [ ] Strengthen transition between Phase 3 (evasion) and Phase 4 (vampire partnership)

### Low Priority
- [ ] Review Volume 0 (Introduction) to ensure it references narrative arc appropriately
- [ ] Consider adding timeline appendix to Introduction volume
- [ ] Document character relationships (Malcolm-Severin, Malcolm-Asmodeus, Theresa Proudmoore connections)

## Notes for Future Reference

### Key Characters in This Series
- **Severin:** Academy vampiric consultant and blood magic specialist. Primary tester for vampire-targeted potions.
- **Asmodeus Asmadel:** Academy Director during most of this period. Approves exchanges with Severin after Malcolm presents them.
- **Theresa Proudmoore:** Blood essence researcher. Severin provides her access to blood magic specialists in exchange for improved holy resistance.

### Strategic Partnership Evolution
1. Academy ← → Monster Hunters (early volumes)
2. Academy forms internal guard (Volume 5)
3. Academy ← → Vampire Consultant (later volumes)
4. Academy gets both hunting access AND vampiric knowledge

### Thematic Progression
1. Enhancing existing formulas (Volumes 6, 7)
2. Combat support and healing (Volume 5)
3. Evasion and escape (Volume 8)
4. Protection against antithetical forces (Volumes 1, 2, 3, 4) - silver, garlic, holy

The series shows Academy growing from research institution to needing active combat capabilities, then forming strategic partnerships (hunters, vampire) to solve different problems.
