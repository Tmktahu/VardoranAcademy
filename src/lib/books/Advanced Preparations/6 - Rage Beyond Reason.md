## How I Developed This Formula
After learning the Ashen Keep's Brew of Ferocity, I couldn't stop thinking about improvements. The hunter's formula worked beautifully, but it left theoretical room for enhancement. Could we make something stronger? More controlled? Longer-lasting?

The answer to "longer-lasting" turned out to be no—60 minutes appears to be the natural limit for these effects. But stronger and more controlled? Yes, absolutely.

The breakthrough came from analyzing why hell's clarion provides physical enhancement. The mushroom's chaos properties don't just increase strength randomly—they specifically amplify aggressive impulses and physical force. What if we combined it with another plant that shares aggressive enhancement properties?

Plague brier, despite its chemical rather than magical origins, demonstrates remarkable synergy with hell's clarion. Both plants enhance destructive capability. Combined in proper proportions, they create something significantly more potent than either alone.

I spent six months testing combinations before landing on 60 parts plague brier to 60 parts hell's clarion. The equal ratio creates perfect balance. The fish bone remains essential for tempering rage effects, though even with it, this formula makes you noticeably more aggressive than the basic brew.
## The Formula
**Ingredients:**
- 60 measures plague brier
- 60 measures hell's clarion
- 1 fish bone
- 1 empty glass bottle

**Preparation:**
Grind plague brier flowers and hell's clarion mushrooms separately. Keep them apart until ready to combine—they react somewhat violently if mixed while dry. I learned this after small workshop fire that singed exactly half my hair.

Pulverize fish bone completely. Add bone powder to plague brier first, mix thoroughly. Then add hell's clarion gradually while stirring constantly. The mixture will warm noticeably as the plants interact. This is normal and indicates proper combination.

Transfer to glass bottle and add clean water to fill. Seal immediately and shake vigorously for two minutes. Let steep for one hour minimum. The potion turns dark red-brown with slight purple tint. Strain before use.

**Effect:**
One bottle provides 60 minutes of significantly enhanced physical power. Your strikes hit approximately 30-35% harder than baseline—nearly double the enhancement of basic Brew of Ferocity. The increased aggression is more pronounced, manifesting as strong urge toward violent solutions and reduced patience for non-combat approaches.

Effect persists through death.
## Practical Uses
Military applications favor this over the basic brew when maximum force is required. Elite shock troops, siege breakers, anyone expecting extremely heavy combat benefits from the enhanced power.

The formula sees less use in monster hunting than you'd expect. Cassandra Ashworth tested it and declared it "too much rage, not enough thinking." Apparently successful monster hunting requires tactical decision-making that aggressive impulses interfere with. She uses basic brew for most hunts, reserves this potion for prey too dangerous to approach cautiously.

Arena champions favor it despite (or because of) the increased aggression. Controlled violence in competitive setting apparently benefits from reduced hesitation.

Some berserker warriors deliberately use the enhanced rage effects, entering battle already predisposed to aggression. I consider this reckless, but documented use exists.
## Development Notes
**Attempt #8:** Tried increasing hell's clarion proportion to 80 while reducing plague brier to 40. Result: uncontrolled rage, multiple broken laboratory implements, apology letter to neighboring researchers.

**Attempt #15:** Thought reducing fish bone might preserve strength while allowing more controlled aggression. Wrong. Just created unstable potion that made test subject attack practice dummy with concerning enthusiasm until effect wore off.

**Attempt #22:** Added mourning lily extract thinking death magic might balance chaos properties. Accomplished nothing except making the potion taste dramatically worse while providing identical effects.

The 60:60:1 ratio proved optimal through extensive testing. Don't adjust it unless you enjoy unpredictable results.
## Comparison with Basic Brew
Students often ask whether this formula renders Brew of Ferocity obsolete. The answer is no, for several reasons:

**Cost:** This requires plague brier, which grows exclusively in chemically contaminated regions. Plague brier is expensive and difficult to source. Hell's clarion alone is significantly cheaper.

**Control:** The basic brew's more moderate aggression enhancement allows better tactical thinking. Sometimes you need to hit harder while still making intelligent decisions.

**Accessibility:** Anyone can make Brew of Ferocity with minimal equipment. This formula requires glass bottles and more precise preparation. Field conditions favor simpler formulations.

Use basic brew for situations requiring strength with control. Use this when maximum destructive force outweighs tactical concerns.
## Important Warnings
The enhanced aggression is not subtle. You will want to hit things. You will struggle with diplomatic approaches. You will find violence extremely appealing as problem-solving method. Plan accordingly—don't drink this before situations requiring restraint.

Don't combine with Brew of Ferocity thinking you'll get additive effects. You won't. You'll just waste materials and feel sick. The mechanisms overlap; only the stronger effect manifests.

Store in sealed glass bottles. The plague brier/hell's clarion combination remains somewhat reactive. I've had bottles develop small cracks from internal pressure when stored incorrectly.

If you find yourself still experiencing intense aggressive impulses two hours after consumption, seek medical attention. That indicates improper preparation or contamination, not normal effect duration.
