# Father Sullivan's 53 Theses
> **Author:** Father Sullivan of Ember Abbey  
> **Written:** 806 AD
## Preface
The following was assembled and distributed by an Abbot who established a small abbey in Farbane around 806 AD. Sullivan had direct distaste for the Church of Luminance, and expressed it via assembling a collection of 53 statements.

Distribution was performed in a moment when Luminance forces had deployed beyond Silverlight. They returned to find piles of papers nailed to doors of churches and cathedrals across the region.

Labeled as heresy, they were taken down promptly and burned. The Academy acquired a copy and has maintained it for historical relevance.
## The 53 Theses
**I.**  The light is a revelatory force and not a guiding one.  It shows us things as they are, but untrusts the actions to our own wills.
**II.**  To act with the light is to act with honesty and clarity to your own motivations.
**III.**  Deception then, especially to members of the church, is a cardinal sin.
**IV.**  The light will reveal all in time and reveals most to those who trust it completely.
**V.**  Honesty is not either simply a fear to make claims, but rather to make a claim you yourself believe with all fervor based on that which your vision sees.  
**VI.**  Those blessed by the light see more than those who do not trust it.  
**VII.**  But trusting one who is blessed is not the same as trusting the light.
**VIII.**  The light urges all to look and see with their own eyes.  A priest ought not to tell a churchgoer what he sees, but rather teach them how to see.
**IX.**  Light imposes its will upon all things it touches.
**X.**  The light has domain of where it touches.
**XI.**  Thereby the light also imposes its will upon those things it does not touch, because it forbids where they may and mayn't pass.
**XII.**  Things forbade by the light are the most controlled by it.
**XIII.**  Thereby, they are most in line to act with the light's will.
**XIV.**  Because the light is revelatory and not guiding, it's placement must reveal a will to us that affects all creatures of the world.
**XV.**  Because the light reveals higher power, it also blinds us to see that power itself.
**XVI.**  The light reveals all things it touches, but imposes will by choosing where to touch and where to not touch, thereby the light desires us to look not just at illuminated but enshadowed aspects of the world.
**XVII.**  Enshadowed aspects, as they are controlled by the light, are thereby illuminated by the light, because light is revelatory and not guiding.
**XVIII.**  If this is false, and we should examine only where the light shines for truth, then it must be no sin to look beyond the light for its source, as that ought to be most bright of all.
**XIX.**  If it is sin to look upon the light because it is bright, then it must not be sin to examine enshadowed things for truth, as taught by the light.
**XX.**  It is sin to ignore or decry truths shown by the light.
**XXI.**  It is sin to keep in secret what might otherwise help your fellows or warn them of great harm.
**XXII.**  It is sin to keep a child of the light from looking upon the world, its truth, and its glory
**XXIII.**  Therefore, it is the light's will that we see things and share them with our fellows to keep them from greater harm.
**XXIV.**  Therefore, the light's foremost commandment is to look.
**XXV.**  If it is the light's foremost commandments to looks, and if both cardinal sins of looking at shadow and light's source can not both be true. Then neither must be true, as keeping one from looking is sin.
**XXVI.**  As the light is not a guiding force but a revelatory one, and it is controlled by some divine will, it must be within that will that there are greater truths to be uncovered, elsewise there would be no more truth of the light
**XXVII.**  The Blood of Dracula spilled upon the land of Vardoran in time long ago, to cleanse the land with light we crusade.
**XXVIII.**  The Creatures possessed by the blood of Dracula are cruel and uncaring wretches to be driven from society, as they meyn't be killed.
**XXIX.**  Thereby the light brings no folly to these creatures, as they mayn't be killed.  
**XXX.**  The light allow creatures of such darkness to remain within the light.  
**XXXI.**  As the Light is a Revelatory force and not a guiding one, we must examine all these creatures with the revelation of the light.
**XXXII.**  Creatures wielding the blood of Dracula are Immortal.
**XXXIII.**  Creatures Wielding the Blood of Dracula are cruel and untrustworthy.
**XXXIV.**  Azariel the Sunbringer took vows 800 years ago, by right of documentation that has survived destruction.
**XXXV.**  The Sunbringer's records were meant to be destroyed, but destruction of records is a sin, thereby, the light reveal truth.
**XXXVI.**  Sister Christina of Dunley has been with the church from the time of the war.
**XXXVII.**  Brother Raziel of Dunley has been with the church from the time of the war.
**XXXVIII.**  Lost Brother Tristan of Farbane has been avowed by church since the times of the war.
**XXXIX.**  Lost Sister Jade of Dunley has been avowed by church since the times of the war.
**XL.**  Sister Meredith of Dunley has been avowed by the church since the times of the war.
**XLI.**  Thereby, all of the above are vampire blooded individuals, whose truths have been hidden.
**XLII.**  Thereby, there have been actors working against the light from within it.
**XLIII.**  Thereby, The Luminance has upon itself need of holy inquisition to rid itself from internal corruption.
**XLIV.**  Because the light is not guiding but revelatory, all members of the church ought ask themselves what they see in the world.  
**XLV.**  Because the light is not guiding but revelatory, and members of the church have guided truth away from people, great sin has occurred.
**XLVI.**  Because great sin has occurred, it is righteous not for current inquisition to continue, but for renewed faith to build upon a new church.
**XLVII.**  All holy men who believe that there is to be great good in the world and who are capable of seeing light, are commanded by light itself therefore to launch inquisition.
**XLVIII.**  The old commandments teach us to build ourselves into commissions and courts in the shire of which we dwell.
**XLIX.**  We must rebuild the church as guided by light, and not by corruption, for great towers only exist to blind us of the sun.
**L.**  All Villages must route out their false prophets and take light into their own hands.
**LI.**  All people must follow the light by their own eyes and not the eyes of the false prophets.
**LII.**  All people must look not just at light, but at shadow, and at the source- luminance, to see what is to be revealed. Because light is a revelatory force and not a guiding one.
