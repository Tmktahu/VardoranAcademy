## How I Developed This Formula
Sun resistance represents critical concern for vampiric researchers. Accidents happen—curtains fail, emergency travel requires daytime movement, experiments generate unexpected light. We've lost too many vampiric students to sun exposure to treat this casually.

The challenge: creating protection against holy light using available plants. Most solar-touched flora are holy-aligned, which obviously doesn't help vampires. The breakthrough came from combining plants associated with death and blood—opposing forces that together create shadow sufficient to block sun's worst effects.

I still don't fully understand why mourning lily and blood rose work together. I asked Ellie about it after my twenty-third failed attempt. Her response: "They're in opposition but not cancellation. Think of it like—" and then she launched into an explanation involving magical state interference patterns and resonance disruption that I couldn't follow. I asked her to simplify. She sighed the way she does when she's decided you're hopeless and said: "The sun burns vampires through direct magical contact with vampiric essence. These plants create opposing magical states that generate noise in that connection. Noise weakens the burning. Is that simple enough for you?"

It was, actually. The plants don't block the sun, they just make the connection fuzzy enough that the burning is reduced.

This formula took thirty-seven attempts before producing consistent results. The early failures ranged from "completely ineffective" to "somehow made sun exposure worse." I'm still not sure how Attempt #22 accomplished that, but three vampire test subjects confirmed increased burning sensation.
## The Formula
**Ingredients:**
- 20 measures mourning lily
- 20 measures blood rose
- 1 empty waterskin

**Preparation:**
Grind mourning lily flowers until finely pulverized. The drooping petals become easier to process once wilted—fresh flowers work but require more effort. Separately grind blood rose petals. Keep them apart until ready to combine.

Mix ground materials together gradually. You'll notice slight warming as they interact—that's normal and indicates proper combination. The warming suggests the plants' opposing natures creating balanced state.

Transfer to waterskin, add clean water to fill. Shake vigorously for one minute, steep 30 minutes minimum. The brew turns muddy red-brown. Not attractive, but effective. Strain before use.

**Effect:**
One waterskin provides increased sun resistance lasting throughout the day. Vampiric users report being able to tolerate brief sun exposure without immediate burning. You won't be comfortable, but you won't immediately combust either. This is emergency protection, not casual sunlight enjoyment.
## Practical Uses
Emergency travel during daylight hours becomes possible with this brew. Vampires needing to move during day can do so briefly with multiple waterskins and careful route planning.

Research applications include studying sun-touched phenomena or materials. Academy vampire researchers use this when examining artifacts or conducting experiments involving solar properties.

Rescue operations sometimes require daylight exposure. Having several waterskins allows vampiric responders to function during emergencies that can't wait for nightfall.

Some vampires report using it for watching sunrises or sunsets from safe positions. I consider this reckless romanticism, but documented use exists.
## Development Failures
**Attempt #14:** Used only mourning lily. Theory: pure shadow should block light. Reality: provided no measurable protection. Shadow without vampiric resonance apparently doesn't translate to sun resistance.

**Attempt #19:** Tried adding sunflower thinking holy trace might help adapt to holy light. Wrong. Just made vampiric test subjects uncomfortable while providing no additional protection.

**Attempt #27:** Increased ratio to 40:40 expecting proportional improvement. Result: waste of materials. Protection level remained identical to 20:20 ratio. The plants reach maximum effectiveness at lower concentrations.

**Attempt #34:** Added fire blossom thinking thermal resistance might help. Accomplished nothing except making brew taste worse and cost more. The burning from sunlight isn't conventional thermal damage—fire resistance doesn't help.
## Important Warnings
This is MINOR sun resistance. You will not be able to walk around casually in daylight. You will still burn, just more slowly. Don't overestimate the protection or you'll learn painful lessons about its limits.

Multiple doses don't stack. Drinking three waterskins doesn't give you three times the protection. Effect has a ceiling—your second waterskin during active protection wastes materials.

If you start feeling burning sensation while under this brew's effect, get out of sunlight immediately. The protection has limits and you're approaching them.
