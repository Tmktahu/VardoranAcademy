## How I Learned This Formula
Mira Ashworth provided this formula during the same visit where she shared Brew of Ferocity. When I asked if they had preparations for magic users, she produced another waterskin.

"We're not all blade-swingers," she said. "Magical support requires its own enhancements. This makes spells hit harder."

I expected different plants, complex preparation, maybe theoretical discussion of magical resonance. Instead: snow flower, fish bone, water. Same basic method as their physical enhancement brew, just different plant source.

The elegant simplicity impressed me more than elaborate formulation would have. The Ashen Keep understands that field alchemy must be practical. Complex preparations fail when you're bleeding in the woods miles from laboratory. Simple formulations you can mix in camp save lives.

This brew represents their magical combat solution—straightforward, reliable, effective. Like their physical enhancement formula, it works because extensive field testing proves it works.
## The Formula
**Ingredients:**
- 32 measures snow flower (fresh preferred for potency)
- 1 fish bone
- 1 empty waterskin

**Preparation:**
Grind snow flowers until finely pulverized. The cold sensation persists even when crushed—normal and indicates active compounds remain intact. Add fish bone and grind together. The bone provides stabilizing properties for snow flower's frost magic affinity.

Transfer to waterskin. Add clean water to fill. Shake vigorously for one minute, let steep 30 minutes minimum. The brew turns pale blue and remains noticeably cool. Strain solids before drinking.

Mira notes hunters prepare this the evening before expected magical combat, drinking immediately upon encountering enemy spellcasters.

**Effect:**
One waterskin provides enhanced spell power throughout the day. Your magical workings manifest noticeably more powerfully than normal. The effect feels like heightened magical sensitivity—spells flow more easily, arcane energy responds more readily to manipulation.
## Practical Uses
Monster hunting against magically-attuned prey obviously benefits from enhanced spell power. Creatures resistant to physical attacks often fall to properly-enhanced magic.

Combat mages in military forces use this brew extensively. Increased spell power translates directly to battlefield effectiveness. Artillery mages find particular benefit—enhanced area-effect spells cover larger zones with increased impact.

The Academy's own combat instructors recommend it for dueling practice. Students learn to manage enhanced magical output in controlled environment before encountering it in actual combat.

Support casters report that healing and protective spells benefit equally. Enhanced spell power applies to all magical workings, not just offensive applications.
## What the Hunters Taught Me
Mira explained their development approach: "We noticed snow flower's frost properties made magic feel stronger when we carried it. Started testing whether consuming it increased effects. Early attempts just made people cold. Adding fish bone made it actually work."

This exemplifies empirical discovery without theoretical understanding. They observed correlation, tested causation, refined through trial and error. No mechanism analysis required—the brew's effectiveness proves itself through use.

I've attempted theoretical explanation: Snow flower's frost affinity somehow resonates with general magical energy manipulation, creating amplification effect. The fish bone's role remains mysterious beyond stabilization. Mira finds my theorizing amusing but ultimately irrelevant: "It works. That's what matters."

She's right, though admitting that bothers me.
## Field Modifications
Hunters have shared several practical variations:

For extended operations, they prepare double batches in two waterskins. One for immediate use, one as backup. The brew maintains potency for about three days when properly sealed.

Some hunters mix this with warming teas to offset snow flower's cooling effect. Doesn't impact magical enhancement but makes consumption more comfortable in cold weather.

Dried snow flower works acceptably when fresh unavailable, though hunters report noticeably reduced effectiveness. They adjust by using more dried flowers or accepting weaker enhancement.
## Important Warnings
Don't assume enhanced spell power automatically means better results. You still need proper technique and control. Stronger spells poorly executed just fail more spectacularly.

Store away from extreme cold despite snow flower's frost affinity. Frozen brew doesn't pour properly. Keep it cold, not frozen.

Fresh preparation works better than stored brew. The fish bone compounds begin degrading after a few days in aqueous solution. Mix it shortly before expected use for optimal results.
