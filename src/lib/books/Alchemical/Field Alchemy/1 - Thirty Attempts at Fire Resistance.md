## How I Discovered This Formula
You'll discover, as I did through several unfortunate incidents, that working with fire blossom extracts requires heat. Heat plus flammable materials equals problems. After my fourth melted waterskin (and one memorable ceiling fire), I realized the plant itself might solve my fire problems.

The breakthrough came from treating fire blossom's heat as an asset rather than a hazard. Oil acts as a thermal buffer, distributing the plant's stored energy in controlled fashion. Thirty failed attempts taught me the correct ratio: 40 parts fire blossom to 1 part oil. Less creates instability. More accomplishes nothing.

I asked Ellie why this even worked years later. She gave me one of her looks—the "how are you this incompetent" look—and said fire blossoms naturally store thermal magical energy. Something about how oil doesn't just buffer the heat, it creates a gradual release mechanism that spreads the protection over time instead of burning through it immediately. I probably mangled that explanation, but the important part is: it works because the plant already contains the protection, we're just making it last longer.
## The Formula
**Ingredients:**
- 40 measures fire blossom (fresh preferred, dried acceptable)
- 1 measure refined oil
- 1 empty waterskin

**Preparation:**
Grind fire blossom flowers thoroughly. Heat oil to warm—not smoking temperature. Add ground blossom gradually while stirring. The mixture should turn golden-orange and release warm scent. Continue heating and stirring for 10 minutes, maintaining gentle warmth without bubbling. If it bubbles, start over. Transfer to waterskin while warm.

**Effect:**
One waterskin's amount lasts about a day. You'll feel gentle warmth spreading through your body as the formula takes effect.
## Practical Uses
Combat situations involving fire magic obviously benefit from this brew. Soldiers, vampires facing flame-wielders, anyone expecting fire exposure should carry waterskins.

Industrial applications include blacksmithing, foundry work, and any profession requiring proximity to open flames. Explorers report success using it in volcanic regions, though I haven't personally tested those conditions.

Interestingly, some users report reduced sunburn, suggesting the thermal protection extends to all heat sources.
## What I Learned From Failure
**Attempt #12:** Distilling fire blossom vapor. Result: small explosion, large scorch marks, difficult explanations.

**Attempt #18:** Animal fat instead of oil. Effective but smelled terrible. Fire resistance means nothing if everyone evacuates before combat.

**Attempt #23:** Water-based solutions. Seemed logical (water extinguishes fire). Accomplished nothing except wasting ingredients.
## Important Warnings
Wear gloves when grinding fire blossom. The crushed flowers maintain heat and can cause burns.

Don't overheat oil during preparation. Smoking oil means temperatures too high. Best case: ruined batch. Worst case: workshop fire.

Store completed brews away from flames. The formula provides fire resistance to whoever drinks it, but the liquid itself remains flammable. I learned this distinction through two workspace fires.
