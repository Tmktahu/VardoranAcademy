## Subjects
- The Red Death pathogen transmission and progression
- Three-stage vampiric disease progression
- Terminal illness management protocols
- Medical personnel safety requirements
- Historical plague documentation
## Observations
Class 5 biological threat affecting vampiric populations exclusively. Historical outbreak 700 years prior eliminated hundreds to single digits within 4 quaternaries. Pattern suggests targeting hedon vampires specifically.

Transmission occurs through blood-to-mucous membrane contact, dermal penetration via compromised skin barriers, and ingestion of contaminated blood products. Environmental contamination during active phases creates exposure risk. High-risk communicability with no immunity factors.
### Disease Staging and Clinical Markers
**Incubation Phase (Cycles 1-3):** Complete symptom absence with undetectable pathogen presence through standard testing protocols. Low infectivity during silent carrier state. Pathogen establishes systemic presence while remaining metabolically inactive.

**Dormancy Phase (Septurn 1):** Primary identification marker involves bilateral iris pigmentation alteration to pink or deep red coloration. Secondary manifestations include mild vestibular dysfunction and intermittent vertigo episodes. Minimal infectivity with full functional capacity maintained. Critical diagnostic window for intervention planning.

**Active Illness Phase (1-5 septurns to terminal outcome):** Triggered exclusively by proximity exposure to multiple vampiric individuals. Pathognomonic sign involves spontaneous hemorrhage through dermal pores creating contamination zones. Additional manifestations include severe vestibular compromise with persistent vertigo, progressive chronic fatigue, pathological increase in sanguinary consumption requirements, bilateral extremity tremors, and elevated frenzy threshold sensitivity.
### Neuropsychiatric Effects
Active phase subjects report visual hallucinations during conscious periods and chromatic dream disturbances featuring red spectrum imagery during torpor. Progressive cognitive deterioration observed in late-stage presentations. Behavioral changes include increased aggression, reduced survival instinct, and compulsive proximity-seeking behavior that accelerates transmission.
### Pathophysiology Assessment
Pathogen targets vampiric blood regulation systems specifically. Proximity-triggered activation mechanisms suggest sophisticated sensing capability detecting vampiric presence. Characteristic pore-based bleeding indicates dermal barrier disruption and vascular integrity compromise. Progressive neurological involvement suggests central nervous system pathology with potential blood-brain barrier penetration.
### Treatment Response and Medical Management
No curative interventions identified. Palliative treatments include specialized blood mixture formulations administered every 2-3 cycles, increased feeding frequency to prevent frenzy episodes, topical pore-sealing compounds for hemorrhage control, and herbal preparations for temporary vestibular symptom relief. Effectiveness decreases with disease progression.

**Medical Personnel Safety:** Glass dome respiratory protection and sealed garment systems mandatory when treating active cases. Standard medical barriers insufficient against blood-borne transmission. Complete decontamination essential following patient contact. Minimal exposure time recommended.

**Patient Management:** Red robe and hood identification markers required for public safety. Complete isolation from group settings necessary to prevent proximity-triggered activation and transmission events.

**Prognosis:** Universally terminal with no documented survivors past active phase onset. Survival duration 1-5 septurns post-dormancy based on treatment compliance, baseline health, and access to specialized blood mixtures.
