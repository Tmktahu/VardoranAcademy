## What Blood Magic Is
Blood magic manipulates life force through transfer and redirection. Severin channels it. I document it. After years of observation, the mechanism is clear: life force exists as tangible magical resource residing in living creatures. Practitioners draw this resource from external targets and redirect it for their own purposes.

Vampires and other immortal beings channel blood magic naturally. Mortal beings cannot channel it from within their own essence. Our finite nature conflicts with manipulating life force directly. Attempting internal channeling causes severe physiological breakdown and physical harm.

Blood magic differs fundamentally from other schools. Frost magic can be studied and learned through practice. Blood magic can be studied and understood through observation, but mortal practitioners cannot perform it. We observe. We theorize. We document what vampiric practitioners demonstrate.
## Life Force as Magical Medium
Life force is animating energy present in flesh and blood creatures. Blood magic treats this energy as transferable resource. Three components required: living target, vampiric channeler, direct connection.

Why blood specifically? Blood carries life force throughout living systems. Blood magic exploits this property. Severin describes it simply: "Blood responds to vampiric will because blood already moves life force naturally. We're just redirecting the flow."

Transfer creates measurable deficit in the target. Equivalent surplus enters the channeler. Blood magic cannot create life force, only transfer it. What leaves the victim enters the vampire. Conservation of magical energy.
## Vampiric Channeling
Vampires channel blood magic innately because their essence is constructed from it. The precise mechanisms of vampiric transformation and its relationship to blood magic are beyond this volume's scope. For comprehensive treatment of vampirism itself, consult [Author Name]'s work.

This inherent channeling ability doesn't mean blood magic requires no instruction. Severin draws the distinction clearly: "Basic channeling is like breathing because I don't think about drawing life force any more than you think about drawing air. But the advanced work? Blood bonds, precise form manipulation, controlled lifeforce redirection? Those are techniques. Those are taught."

The fundamental ability is innate. The deeper structuring can be learned. A vampire channels blood magic by nature, but mastering its applications, which includes establishing blood bonds, crafting precise forms, and manipulating lifeforce with surgical control, requires instruction and practice.

Human practitioners face an absolute barrier to internal channeling. Our biological structure cannot sustain blood magic channeling from within. The magic requires immortal essence as foundation. Blood magic study at the Academy relies on external expertise. We document observations. We build theoretical frameworks based on what vampiric practitioners demonstrate and teach.
## Life Force Applications
Blood magic establishes connection through contact, which includes physical strikes, manifested projectiles, and shaped constructs. While connected, the practitioner draws life force from the target. The connection appears temporary but sufficient for transfer.

Claimed life force can be directed toward multiple uses. Practitioners can also draw on their own life force reserves to power blood magic effects, though this comes at direct cost. Severin describes it as "spending blood to buy blood, so you'd better get a good exchange rate."

One application is shaping life force into forms. It acts as raw material, shaped to the practitioner's will. This represents the most complex application because it requires both precise life force control and spell form shaping ability.

The magic's parasitic nature creates strategic preference. Blood magic practitioners benefit significantly from having viable external sources. While they can draw on personal reserves, claiming from external sources provides sustainable operation. This is not optional for effective practice.
## External Sources and Augmentation
Mortal beings cannot channel blood magic internally but can manipulate external sources. This primarily involves rubies, which possess natural affinity for blood magic.

Rubies serve multiple functions. They shape blood magic as it passes through them, which is like a lens focusing light. An attuned ruby can enhance effects, modify manifestations, alter how the magic operates. The practitioner still channels the blood magic. The ruby augments the channeling.

Rubies also store blood magic for ritual purposes. A vampire can channel blood magic into a properly prepared ruby where it remains viable for extended periods with minimal degradation. A mortal can later use that stored magic in ritual applications. This differs fundamentally from channeling. The mortal manipulates existing magical energy rather than generating new effects.
## Theoretical Boundaries
Blood magic excels at sustaining practitioners but faces clear limitations. Vampiric practitioners can draw on their own life force, but this creates dangerous depletion. The magic strongly favors parasitic operation.

Lifeless materials provide no life force. Practitioners without viable living sources must draw on personal reserves or refrain from using the magic. This is absolute.

Advanced applications like fleshcrafting push beyond simple transfer into active tissue manipulation. Volume 3 addresses these ritual applications in detail.

The framework is straightforward:
- Life force exists as transferable resource.
- Immortal beings channel blood magic innately.
- Transfer requires connection with living targets.
- Rubies augment channeling or store magic for ritual use.
