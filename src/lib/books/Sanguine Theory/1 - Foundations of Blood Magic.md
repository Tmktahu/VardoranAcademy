## What Blood Magic Is
Based on extensive observation, I define blood magic as the direct manipulation of life force through transfer and redirection. Life force exists as tangible magical resource residing in living creatures. Blood magic practitioners draw this resource from external targets and redirect it for their own purposes.

The magic is innately vampiric. Vampires and other immortal beings channel blood magic naturally. Mortal beings cannot channel it from within their own essence—their finite nature conflicts with manipulating life force directly. Attempting to do so causes severe physiological breakdown.

This makes blood magic fundamentally different from other schools. Frost magic can be studied and learned. Blood magic can be studied and understood, but mortal practitioners cannot perform it. We observe. We theorize. We document what vampiric practitioners demonstrate.
## Life Force as Magical Medium
Life force is animating energy present in blood and flesh creatures. Blood magic treats this energy as resource that can be drawn from living targets, requiring three components: living target, vampiric channeler, and direct connection.

Why blood specifically? Blood carries life force throughout living systems; blood magic exploits this property. Severin describes it simply: "Blood responds to vampiric will because blood already moves life force naturally. We're just redirecting the flow."

My observations confirm that transfer creates measurable deficit in the target while providing equivalent surplus to the channeler. Blood magic cannot create life force, only transfer it. What leaves the victim enters the vampire.
## Vampiric Channeling
Vampires channel blood magic innately because their essence is constructed from it. Vampirism itself appears to be blood magic made permanent. The transformation restructures fundamental magical composition.

This means vampires don't "learn" blood magic the way students learn frost manipulation. They exercise inherent property of existence. Severin notes: "You're asking me to explain how I breathe. I don't think about the mechanism—I just do it."

Human practitioners face absolute barrier. Our biological structure cannot sustain internal blood magic channeling. The magic requires immortal essence as foundation. Blood magic study at the Academy relies on external expertise—we document observations and build theoretical frameworks.
## Life Force Applications
Blood magic establishes connection between caster and target through contact—physical strike, manifested projectile, shaped construct. While connected, the practitioner draws life force from the target. The connection appears temporary but sufficient.

The claimed life force can be directed toward self-restoration, ally healing, or shaped manifestation. Vampiric practitioners can also draw on their own life force reserves to power blood magic effects or create temporary physical enhancements, though this comes at direct cost. Severin describes it as "spending blood to buy blood—you'd better get a good exchange rate."

Shaped manifestation uses life force as raw material for magical constructs—projectiles, animated forms, other combat effects. This represents the most complex application because it requires both transfer skill and construct shaping ability.

I've observed that the magic's parasitic nature creates strategic preference: blood magic practitioners benefit significantly from having viable targets. While they can draw on personal reserves, claiming from external sources provides sustainable operation.
## External Sources and Augmentation
Mortal beings cannot channel blood magic internally but can manipulate external sources. This primarily involves rubies, which possess natural affinity for blood magic. Other gemstones attune to their corresponding magical schools in similar fashion.

Rubies don't store power for later use in the way many assume. Instead, they shape blood magic as it passes through them—think of it as lens focusing light. An attuned ruby can enhance effects, modify manifestations, or alter how the magic operates. The practitioner still channels the blood magic; the ruby augments the channeling.

This distinction matters. A vampire can use an attuned ruby during combat or ritual work to shape their blood magic differently. A mortal cannot channel blood magic through a ruby because mortals cannot channel blood magic at all. Severin finds this tiresome: "You're asking how to use blood magic without being vampire. You can't. The ruby shapes the magic, it doesn't replace the channeler."

The one exception involves stored blood magic for ritual purposes. A vampire can channel blood magic into a properly prepared ruby where it remains viable for extended periods with minimal degradation. A mortal can later use that stored magic in ritual applications. This differs fundamentally from channeling—the mortal manipulates existing magical energy rather than generating new effects.
## Theoretical Boundaries
Based on my research, blood magic excels at sustaining practitioners but faces clear limitations. Vampiric practitioners can draw on their own life force, but this creates dangerous depletion. The magic strongly favors parasitic operation.

Claiming life force from targets requires blood and flesh creatures. Lifeless materials provide no life force. Practitioners without viable enemies must draw on personal reserves or refrain from using the magic.

Advanced applications like fleshcrafting push beyond simple transfer into active tissue manipulation. These will be addressed in later volumes.

The framework is straightforward. Life force exists as transferable resource. Immortal beings channel blood magic innately. Transfer requires connection with living targets. Rubies augment channeling or store magic for ritual use. Understanding theory doesn't grant capability. Accept this or find different research.
