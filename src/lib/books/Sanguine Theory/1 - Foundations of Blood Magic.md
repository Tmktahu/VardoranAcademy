## What Blood Magic Is
Based on extensive observation, I define blood magic as the direct manipulation of life force through transfer and redirection. Life force exists as a tangible magical resource residing in living creatures. Blood magic practitioners draw this resource from external targets and redirect it for their own purposes.

Vampires and other immortal beings channel blood magic naturally. Mortal beings cannot channel it from within their own essence—their finite nature conflicts with manipulating life force directly. Attempting to do so causes severe physiological breakdown and physical harm.

This makes blood magic fundamentally different from other schools. Frost magic can be studied and learned. Blood magic can be studied and understood, but mortal practitioners cannot perform it. We observe. We theorize. We document what vampiric practitioners demonstrate.
## Life Force as Magical Medium
Life force is animating energy present in flesh and blood creatures. Blood magic treats this energy as a resource that can be drawn from living targets, requiring three components: living target, vampiric channeler, and direct connection.

Why blood specifically? Blood carries life force throughout living systems; blood magic exploits this property. Severin describes it simply: "Blood responds to vampiric will because blood already moves life force naturally. We're just redirecting the flow."

My observations confirm that transfer creates measurable deficit in the target while providing equivalent surplus to the channeler. Blood magic cannot create life force, only transfer it. What leaves the victim enters the vampire.
## Vampiric Channeling
Vampires channel blood magic innately because their essence is constructed from it. The precise mechanisms of vampiric transformation and its relationship to blood magic are beyond the scope of this volume. For comprehensive treatment of vampirism itself, I refer readers to [Author Name]'s work on the subject.

This means vampires don't "learn" blood magic the way students learn frost manipulation. They exercise an inherent property of their existence. Severin notes: "You're asking me to explain how I breathe. I don't think about the mechanism—I just do it."

Human practitioners face an absolute barrier. Our biological structure cannot sustain internal blood magic channeling. The magic requires immortal essence as a foundation. Blood magic study at the Academy relies on external expertise—we document observations and build theoretical frameworks.
## Life Force Applications
Blood magic establishes a connection between caster and target through contact—physical strike, manifested projectile, shaped construct. While connected, the practitioner draws life force from the target. The connection appears temporary but sufficient.

The claimed life force can be directed toward a variety of uses. Practitioners can also draw on their own life force reserves to power blood magic effects, though this comes at direct cost. Severin describes it as "spending blood to buy blood—you'd better get a good exchange rate."

One use is to shape the life force into forms. It acts as raw material, shaped to the will of the practitioner. This represents the most complex application because it requires both precise life force control and spell form shaping ability.

I've observed that the magic's parasitic nature creates strategic preference: blood magic practitioners benefit significantly from having viable external sources. While they can draw on personal reserves, claiming from external sources provides sustainable operation.
## External Sources and Augmentation
Mortal beings cannot channel blood magic internally but can manipulate external sources. This primarily involves rubies, which possess natural affinity for blood magic.

Rubies have a few uses. In one use case, they shape blood magic as it passes through them—think of it as lens focusing light. An attuned ruby can enhance effects, modify manifestations, or alter how the magic operates. The practitioner still channels the blood magic; the ruby augments the channeling.

Another use involves stored blood magic for ritual purposes. A vampire can channel blood magic into a properly prepared ruby where it remains viable for extended periods with minimal degradation. A mortal can later use that stored magic in ritual applications. This differs fundamentally from channeling—the mortal manipulates existing magical energy rather than generating new effects.
## Theoretical Boundaries
Based on my research, blood magic excels at sustaining practitioners but faces clear limitations. Vampiric practitioners can draw on their own life force, but this creates dangerous depletion. The magic strongly favors parasitic operation.

Lifeless materials provide no life force. Practitioners without viable living sources must draw on personal reserves or refrain from using the magic.

Advanced applications like fleshcrafting push beyond simple transfer into active tissue manipulation. These will be addressed in later volumes.

The framework is straightforward. 
- Life force exists as a transferable resource.
- Immortal beings channel blood magic innately.
- Transfer requires connection with living targets.
- Rubies augment channeling or store magic for ritual use.

Understanding theory doesn't grant capability. Accept this or find different research.
