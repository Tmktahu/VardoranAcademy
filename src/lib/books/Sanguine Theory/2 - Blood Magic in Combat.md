## Combat Philosophy
Blood magic practitioners approach combat differently from other schools. Where frost mages manage resources carefully and chaos practitioners risk burnout, blood mages grow stronger through prolonged engagement when they maintain consistent accuracy. The parasitic cycle sustains them. Damage dealt claims life force from enemies. Claimed life force enables continued assault. When claiming exceeds expenditure, combat becomes self-sustaining.

This creates a clear skill divide. Practitioners who land their strikes consistently can sustain indefinitely through life force recovery. The longer the fight, the more their advantage compounds. Practitioners who fail to hit their targets frequently deplete personal reserves faster than they can replenish them.

Skilled blood magic practitioners favor sustained combat over decisive strikes. They outlast opponents through attrition, growing more dangerous as battles extend. Severin describes it bluntly: "The longer the fight, the better my odds... as long as I'm hitting. Every successful exchange makes me stronger and my enemy weaker."
## Manifestation Forms
Blood magic takes visible form through shaped life force, which include projectiles and animated constructs of condensed life force given temporary structure. The most common manifestations resemble blood itself: crimson projectiles, spreading pools, vertical fountains. Some practitioners create more complex forms like swarms of spectral creatures.

Manifestation complexity correlates with practitioner skill. Severin notes: "Beginners throw red bolts. Experts weave sustained effects that persist beyond initial casting. The magic is identical. The control differs."

These manifestations deliver harm while establishing connection for life force transfer. The projectile that wounds your enemy contains life force taken from previous victims, redirected toward combat effect. Practitioners draw on personal reserves to fuel manifestations. They claim from enemies to replenish expenditure. This cycle must remain positive or the practitioner depletes.

Attuned rubies can modify manifestations as blood magic passes through them, altering effects or enhancing particular aspects. The ruby shapes the channeling but doesn't replace the practitioner's own life force expenditure.
## Physical Enhancement
Practitioners expend life force to augment physical capability temporarily. These enhancements manifest as brief bursts like heightened awareness, accelerated movement, increased striking power and speed. More life force expended means stronger enhancement, though practitioners must maintain sufficient reserves for continued combat.

Enhancement applies primarily to physical attributes rather than granting tactical genius or magical insight. It makes practitioners faster and stronger for seconds at a time. This improves their ability to land strikes and maintain connections with targets. Physical capability translates directly to magical effectiveness.
## Sustained Engagement
Blood magic excels in prolonged combat. Where other schools deplete themselves through continuous spell use, blood mages maintain operational capacity through parasitic life force transfer. The healing effect of claiming life force provides sustainability that other magical schools cannot match.

Practitioners avoid burst tactics in favor of steady pressure. Continuous low-intensity harm generates steady life force flow. The enemy weakens gradually while the practitioner remains sustained through ongoing recovery. The approach requires patience. Victories take time through accumulated advantage.

I've documented this pattern across hundreds of engagements. The blood mage who survives the opening exchange and establishes the claiming cycle becomes progressively harder to defeat. The opponent races against time. The blood mage races toward inevitability.
## Combat Limitations and Vulnerabilities
Blood magic's defensive strength lies in recovery rather than prevention. Where other schools use barriers or redirection, blood magic provides minimal shielding. Practitioners execute reactive counters that disrupt enemy attacks while establishing connection for life force transfer. Even defense becomes offense.

Severin explains: "Defense means killing them faster than they kill you. Let them land hits if you're claiming more life force than they're taking."

This creates vulnerability against concentrated assault. Practitioners facing overwhelming burst damage lack conventional defensive options. Their survival depends on maintaining life force transfer through landing strikes. If enemy force prevents offensive action, the practitioner cannot recover. Burst damage that exceeds claiming rate kills blood mages.

The parasitic nature requires viable targets with life force to claim. Constructs, certain undead, and other entities lacking true life force present serious challenges. Practitioners facing these opponents rely entirely on personal reserves, a losing proposition in extended combat. 

Extended combat also creates mental burden. Managing connections, shaping manifestations, and directing enhancements demands sustained focus. Severin notes: "The life force sustains your body. Your mind still tires from the effort." Physical endurance through life force claiming doesn't prevent mental exhaustion from complex channeling.
