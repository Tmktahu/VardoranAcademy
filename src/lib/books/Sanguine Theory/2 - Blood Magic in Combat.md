## Combat Philosophy
Blood magic practitioners approach combat differently from other schools. Where frost mages manage resources carefully and chaos practitioners risk burnout, blood mages grow stronger through prolonged engagement. The parasitic cycle sustains them: damage dealt claims life force from enemies, claimed life force enables continued assault. When claiming exceeds expenditure, combat becomes self-sustaining.

Based on my observations, blood magic practitioners favor sustained combat over decisive strikes. They outlast opponents through attrition, growing more dangerous as battles extend. Severin describes it bluntly: "The longer the fight, the better my odds. Every exchange makes me stronger and my enemy weaker."
## Manifestation Forms
Blood magic takes visible form through shaped life force—projectiles and animated constructs of condensed life force given temporary structure. The most common manifestations resemble blood itself: crimson projectiles, spreading pools, vertical fountains. Some practitioners create more complex forms like swarms of spectral creatures.

Severin notes that manifestation complexity correlates with practitioner skill: "Beginners throw red bolts. Experts weave sustained effects that persist beyond initial casting. The magic is identical. The control differs."

These manifestations deliver harm while establishing connection for life force transfer. The projectile that wounds your enemy contains life force taken from previous victims, redirected toward combat effect. Practitioners draw on personal reserves to fuel manifestations, claiming from enemies to replenish expenditure.

Attuned rubies can modify manifestations as blood magic passes through them, altering effects or enhancing particular aspects. The ruby shapes the channeling but doesn't replace the practitioner's own life force expenditure.
## Physical Enhancement
Practitioners expend life force to augment physical capability temporarily. These enhancements manifest as brief bursts—heightened awareness, accelerated movement, increased striking power and speed. More life force expended means stronger enhancement, though practitioners must maintain sufficient reserves for continued combat.

I've observed that enhancement applies primarily to physical attributes rather than granting tactical genius or magical insight. It makes practitioners faster and stronger for seconds at a time, improving their ability to land strikes and maintain connections with targets.
## Sustained Engagement
Based on extensive documentation, blood magic excels in prolonged combat. Where other schools deplete themselves through continuous spell use, blood mages maintain operational capacity through parasitic life force transfer. The healing effect of claiming life force provides sustainability that other magical schools cannot match.

Practitioners avoid burst tactics in favor of steady pressure. Continuous low-intensity harm generates steady life force flow. The enemy weakens gradually while the practitioner remains sustained through ongoing recovery. The approach requires patience—victories take time through accumulated advantage.
## Combat Limitations and Vulnerabilities
Blood magic's defensive strength lies in recovery rather than prevention. Where other schools use barriers or redirection, blood magic provides minimal shielding. Practitioners execute reactive counters that disrupt enemy attacks while establishing connection for life force transfer—even defense becomes offense.

Severin explains: "Defense means killing them faster than they kill you. Let them land hits if you're claiming more life force than they're taking."

This creates vulnerability against concentrated assault. Practitioners facing overwhelming burst damage lack conventional defensive options. Their survival depends on maintaining life force transfer through landing strikes. If enemy force prevents offensive action, the practitioner cannot recover.

The parasitic nature requires viable targets. Without enemies to claim from, practitioners rely entirely on personal reserves—a losing proposition in extended combat. I've also observed that extended combat creates mental burden. Managing connections, shaping manifestations, and directing enhancements demands sustained focus. As Severin notes: "The life force sustains your body. Your mind still tires from the effort."
