## Nature of Ritual Applications
Blood magic ritual work operates on different principles than immediate-effect applications. Ritual practitioners have time for preparation, careful control, and sustained operations. This permits complexity that rapid applications cannot achieve, including proper material preparation, controlled environmental conditions, and precise execution without external pressure.

Controlled environments also permit reliance on external life force sources. Practitioners can draw from stored blood magic in prepared rubies, prepared blood samples, or willing donors without managing personal reserves under duress. Severin characterizes the distinction bluntly: "Ritual is spending life force carefully and claiming it completely. You're not fighting for your life while you work."

The difference is fundamental. Combat blood magic emphasizes speed and sustainability through parasitic claiming. Ritual blood magic emphasizes precision and control through prepared resources and methodical application.
## Blood Magic as Ritual Component
Beyond pure blood magic workings, the school serves as component in multi-school ritual applications. Life force can fuel or enhance rituals drawing from other magical traditions. This creates effects that single-school approaches cannot achieve.

Blood itself serves as ritual material independent of active channeling. Fresh blood contains ambient life force even without magical manipulation. Ritualists incorporate it where that inherent presence matters to the working's success. Sometimes the material properties of blood suffice without requiring active blood magic channeling.

The Academy maintains strict oversight regarding blood acquisition. Willing donation differs fundamentally from coerced extraction, both ethically and legally. Practitioners who cannot demonstrate ethical sourcing face immediate censure and potential expulsion. This is not negotiable.
## Healing Applications
Healing represents blood magic's most developed ritual application. Ritual healing addresses injuries through targeted life force application. Wounds close properly. Bones mend correctly. Illness responds when natural vitality proves insufficient.

Limb restoration represents the maximum known achievement during my time at the Academy. Complex work requiring extensive preparation, multiple skilled practitioners, and substantial life force investment over extended periods. Success depends heavily on practitioner skill, available resources, and injury specifics. Even under ideal conditions, restoration proves difficult and does not always succeed. Whether more advanced healing techniques exist or will be developed, I cannot say.

Life force transfer cannot resurrect the dead. This remains absolute. Blood magic accelerates natural healing processes and sustains failing vitality, but does not reverse death. All documented attempts at resurrection through blood magic have failed. The distinction between sustaining life and restoring it is fundamental.

Chronic conditions present different challenges than acute injuries. Some practitioners maintain patients on sustained life force infusion, which represents regular treatments providing ongoing support when the body cannot maintain necessary vitality independently. Severin describes this approach pragmatically: "You're keeping the patient operational, not curing them. Like propping up a failing structure; remove the support and it collapses." 

The patient receives periodic life force treatments to maintain stability rather than achieve cure. This proves resource-intensive but keeps otherwise failing systems operational. I've documented cases where patients receive weekly or daily treatments depending on condition severity. The approach works. It does not cure.
## Sustained Workings
Some applications require sustained investment rather than single performances. These operations maintain effects through continuous or periodic life force infusion.

Preservation applications prove straightforward. Life force presence counteracts natural decay in organic materials. Medical practitioners use this for organ transplantation, maintaining tissue viability during transport. Scholars preserve specimens for extended study without degradation. The mechanism appears consistent: active life force investment prevents natural decay processes.

These sustained workings create ongoing demands. The practitioner or designated replacement must maintain the working through periodic renewal. Missed renewals cause effect degradation. Complete cessation returns materials to natural state, often rapidly. I've observed specimens preserved for months decay within days of the preservation ending.

This creates practical limitations. Sustained workings require sustained commitment. Practitioners cannot maintain dozens of preservation workings simultaneously. Resource allocation becomes critical when managing multiple sustained effects.
