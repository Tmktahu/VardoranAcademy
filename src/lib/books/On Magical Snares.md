## Formation and Nature
Magical snares are discrete pockets of magical energy trapped within the earth. The most accurate analogy is air bubbles forming in dough: energy accumulates in a pocket, and that pocket slowly rises toward the surface. This process is not instantaneous. Snares migrate over extended periods, and surface emergence represents the conclusion of a long ascent.

Each snare contains a single school of magic. Compositions do not mix. Entropic snares are the most common, which is consistent with the volume of entropic energy released during the Age of Entropy (AD 1-807) and its tendency to saturate subsurface material. Snares of all eight magical schools have been documented, though non-entropic examples are less frequent. Distribution is not uniform. Concentrations are reported in areas of historical significance from the previous era, with additional isolated occurrences elsewhere.
## Volatility
A snare's proximity to the surface correlates directly with its instability. Deep snares present no observable hazard. As one approaches the surface, the energy within becomes increasingly reactive. A snare that breaks through without proper handling will discharge uncontrollably, producing magical explosions or uncontrolled energy release of a magnitude proportional to the snare's size and school composition.

Uncontained emergence is not a theoretical concern. It is an active operational risk requiring managed response.
## Current Containment Method
The Cult of Axiom has developed a functional, if hazardous, method for snare handling. The procedure follows three steps:
- first, opposite magic is used to contain the snare
- second, the contained energy is transferred into a vessel
- third, the energy is dispersed safely through the Spire structure

The vessel used in this method is a person. This is the point of highest risk.

The vessel must be an expert in the school of magic being contained. A properly attuned individual can hold the energy of a single snare, but this pushes the bounds of their magical core. If the vessel is incapacitated during transfer, the energy discharges through them. The result is explosive and produces severe magical core damage to the vessel, assuming survival.

Entropic snares require specific note. The Cult has stated that a rotling can contain entropic magic, and that any other vessel attempting to hold entropic energy would produce catastrophic results. This claim has not been independently verified but should be treated as accurate until evidence suggests otherwise.
## Gem-Vessel Alternative
According to information provided by the Cult, approximately 200 perfect gems can store the energy from a single snare. This figure is a threshold, not a target. Advanced materials and constructed vessels may reduce this requirement, but no confirmed design exists as of this writing. This line of research represents a safer alternative to the person-vessel method and is being actively pursued.

The primary advantage of a gem-vessel is the elimination of a living person from the highest-risk stage of the procedure. The primary obstacle is material cost and the engineering challenge of constructing a vessel capable of holding the required volume of energy in a stable configuration. These are solvable problems.
## Detection
The Cult has provided a map of known snare locations. Their method for determining where and when snares will emerge has not been shared. The Oasis spirit has demonstrated an ability to detect snares independently. Neither method is currently replicable by Academy personnel.
