## Description and Habitat
The plague brier displays distinctive bright yellow star-shaped flowers with sharp, spiky petals radiating outward like miniature suns. The blooms grow on curved brown stems that emerge from clusters of leaves. The plant produces thick, thorny briars that require iron or stronger implements to harvest safely, as lesser tools prove insufficient to penetrate the woody growth.

Plague brier grows exclusively in Gloomrot South, specifically in areas contaminated by chemical waste from Transcendum facilities. The plants thrive in soil saturated with industrial runoff, demonstrating remarkable tolerance for toxins that kill most vegetation. The species emerged following Transcendum's establishment in what was once forested land, appearing as accumulated waste reached sufficient concentration.

The plant's ability to flourish in chemically poisoned ground marks it as fundamentally adapted to or created by industrial contamination rather than natural processes.
## Theories of Origin
The plague brier's exclusive growth in chemically contaminated areas and its emergence following Transcendum's establishment suggest the plant represents either rapid mutation of native flora or spontaneous generation from concentrated industrial waste. The relatively swift appearance following initial contamination suggests adaptive response rather than gradual evolution.

Researcher Oliver Tracy proposed an alternative theory: plague brier represents mutated mourning lily lineage. Tracy noted significant morphological similarities between the species and observed that both plants demonstrate necromantic properties despite vastly different growing environments. Most compelling, both species specifically enhance horse agility and pivoting response when used as feed, an unusually specific shared trait. Tracy theorized that mourning lilies growing near Gloomrot's borders encountered Transcendum chemical runoff and underwent rapid mutation over several generations, retaining their necromantic affinity while developing new chemical-based properties. This would explain the convergence of death magic and industrial contamination in a single species.

Unlike magical corruption that warps through arcane energies, plague brier emerged from scientific contamination. The distinction proves significant: the plant demonstrates properties typically associated with necromantic magic despite purely chemical origins. This convergence of industrial and mystical properties remains poorly understood, though Tracy's mourning lily hypothesis offers one possible explanation.
## Harvesting and Preparation
Harvest requires iron or superior quality tools, as the thorny briars resist lesser implements. Protective gloves essential; contact with fresh plant material causes chemical burns in most handlers. The flowers themselves prove less hazardous than the supporting structure.

Fresh specimens maintain superior potency. Chemical degradation occurs rapidly once separated from contaminated soil substrate. Dried specimens retain approximately 40% effectiveness. Grinding to powder reduces potency further but extends shelf life. Seeds require chemically contaminated growing medium; standard soil produces failed germination.
## Properties and Applications
Plague brier appears in formulations designed to provide silver resistance. Practitioners report the plant produces effective protection against silver exposure despite its industrial rather than magical origins. The mechanism by which chemically-derived vegetation produces defensive properties typically associated with magical plants remains unexplained, representing a theoretical challenge to conventional alchemical understanding.

Alchemists employ plague brier in preparations that significantly amplify physical aggression and destructive capability. When combined with hell's clarion, practitioners report the mixture produces intense rage states that dramatically enhance damage output. Alternative formulations incorporating hell's clarion and blood essence apparently enhance unholy workings focused on peak power manifestation. Preparations combining corrupted flower and blood essence reportedly improve spell precision and impact, suggesting the plant's properties extend beyond simple rage enhancement.

When processed with mutant grease, plague brier apparently produces highly mutagenic compounds. Reports indicate these substances dramatically increase blood production in living subjects, though they carry significant mutation risk. Documented cases suggest approximately 30% of subjects exposed to concentrated preparations undergo transformation into monstrous forms. The mechanism appears related to the plant's chemical origins rather than magical properties, representing a concerning intersection of industrial contamination and biological transformation.

Plague brier features in certain necromantic applications. Practitioners report the plant attracts mosquito swarms when properly prepared and enables banshee manifestations in specific formulations. The convergence of chemical corruption and death magic properties presents theoretical difficulties but demonstrates practical consistency across multiple documented cases.

Horse trainers incorporating plague brier into feed report improved agility and pivoting response, though concerns persist regarding long-term health effects of exposing animals to chemically-derived vegetation.
