## Description and Habitat
The snow flower is easily identified by its distinctive pale blue to white star-shaped blossoms, typically displaying five to six delicate petals arranged around a bright yellow center. The flowers grow on tall, slender stems rising from clusters of dark green blade-like leaves. Multiple blooms emerge from each plant, creating small colonies in favorable conditions.

The flowers are notably cold to the touch, often several degrees cooler than the surrounding air. In humid conditions, tiny beads of condensation frequently form on the petals, giving them a frost-kissed appearance even in warm weather. This persistent chill marks the plant's magical nature and its inherent affinity with frost magic.

Despite this frost association, snow flowers do not grow in cold or mountainous regions. Instead, they thrive in temperate woodlands, open farmlands, and hilly terrain with moderate climate. The plant favors well-drained soil and partial sunlight, growing readily in areas that receive regular rainfall without becoming waterlogged.
## Theories of Origin
The snow flower's widespread distribution and hardy nature suggest it may predate Dracula's conquest. The plant's inherent frost magic affinity appears to be a fundamental aspect of its nature rather than a recent development.

The plant's name derives directly from its inherent connection to frost magic and the characteristic cold that emanates from its blossoms. The contrast between the flower's fragile aesthetic and its powerful alchemical applications continues to puzzle researchers.
## Harvesting and Preparation
Flowers should be harvested when fully opened, as immature blooms contain lower concentrations of active compounds. The cold nature of the petals makes them somewhat less prone to heat damage during handling, though they remain delicate and bruise easily.

For medical applications, fresh petals are crushed and cold-steeped in low-mineral water, producing an extract with strong vasoconstrictive properties. Fresh preparation yields optimal effectiveness. Dried flowers retain some properties but with significantly reduced potency. The flowers can be ground to pollen, though this process destroys much of their magical effectiveness. Seeds can be collected from mature plants for cultivation.
## Properties and Applications
Snow flower appears with notable frequency in alchemical preparations designed to provide silver resistance. The plant's consistent incorporation into such formulations suggests properties that counteract or neutralize silver's harmful effects, though the specific mechanism remains subject to alchemical investigation. The frost affinity observable in the living plant may contribute to this protective quality.

Alchemists frequently employ snow flower in spell enhancement preparations. Reports from practitioners indicate marked improvements in magical potency and stability when such preparations are consumed prior to spellwork. Whether the plant's frost magic affinity provides direct amplification or merely stabilizes existing magical energies warrants further study. The plant appears across diverse enhancement formulations: physical prowess compounds, vitality preparations, and regenerative mixtures, suggesting broad compatibility with multiple magical properties.

Horse trainers incorporate snow flower into feed preparations with reported improvements in both speed and stamina. These effects manifest even without alchemical processing, suggesting the plant's enhancement properties operate through direct biological mechanisms rather than requiring magical activation. The consistency of these reports across multiple regions indicates genuine efficacy rather than placebo effect.

Snow flower extract serves as vasoconstrictive agent in two established medical protocols. Primary application: Protocol 08 (Coldpress Clotting Compound) for hemostasis stabilization. Fresh petals crushed and cold-steeped in low-mineral water for 4-6 hours produce extract with strong blood flow reduction properties. Extract potency window: 12 hours post-extraction. Preparation beyond this timeframe demonstrates degraded efficacy.

Blend specifications for Protocol 08: 2 parts bloodrose distillate to 1 part snow flower extract. Cotton fiber matrix saturated with mixture. Applied to bleeding sites, compound sharply reduces blood flow in applied region while bloodrose initiates soft tissue closure. Characteristic cold sensation noted in 100% of test subjects. Treatment produces rapid external scab formation.

Secondary application: Protocol 10 (Trifold Anesthetic Draught) for nerve dulling and sedation. Snow flower component induces localized numbness. Formulation: 1 part snow flower, 2 parts trippy shroom, mourning lily extract added dropwise. Steep 7 minutes in warm base liquid. For ingestion: 30-40mL produces unconsciousness within 8-10 minutes. For local injection: 0.5-1.0mL subdermal produces numbness onset 30-90 seconds.

Frost affinity appears mechanistically relevant to vasoconstrictive properties. Plant's inherent cold nature translates to physiological cooling effect that slows blood circulation in treatment area. Tested across 20+ subjects with consistent results. No adverse reactions to extract itself. Complications arise from degraded preparations or improper extraction method.
