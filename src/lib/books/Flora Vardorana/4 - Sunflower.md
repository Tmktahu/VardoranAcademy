## Description and Habitat
The sunflower displays distinctive large flower heads with bright yellow petals radiating from dark central discs. The blooms grow atop tall, sturdy stems that can reach impressive heights. Large, broad leaves provide substantial foliage. The flower heads track the sun's movement across the sky, a characteristic that holds particular significance for those who cultivate them.

Sunflowers grow exclusively on cultivated farms, particularly in the Dunley Farmlands where the Church of Luminance maintains strong influence. The plant never appears in wild or uncultivated areas, demonstrating complete dependence on human cultivation for propagation. This absolute lack of naturalization suggests foreign origin rather than native species.

The sunflower's exclusive presence in farmland under Church influence and its symbolic importance mark it as an intentionally maintained devotional plant rather than agricultural crop.
## Theories of Origin
The sunflower is not native to Vardoran. The Church of Luminance introduced the species, likely from distant lands, drawn by the flower's powerful sun symbolism. The Church's theology centers heavily on light and solar imagery, and the sunflower's sun-tracking behavior and radiant appearance made it an ideal devotional plant.

Church-aligned farmers cultivate sunflowers not primarily for material harvest but as acts of reverence. The plants serve as living symbols of faith, their daily tracking of the sun seen as natural worship. This sustained devotion and symbolic association appears to have transferred trace amounts of holy essence into the plants themselves. Unlike sacred grapes, where holy properties emerged through genetic mutation from ritual exposure, sunflowers absorb holy energy through sustained worship and symbolic reverence directed at them.

The mechanism differs significantly from other holy-touched plants but produces similar results: flora carrying trace divine essence without containing enough to harm vampiric handlers directly.
## Harvesting and Preparation
Harvest flower heads when fully mature and seeds have developed. The tall stems require cutting tools but present no unusual difficulties. No special precautions necessary; trace holy content insufficient to cause harm during handling.

Fresh specimens maintain superior properties. Dried flowers retain effectiveness with minimal degradation. The flowers can be ground to pollen for various applications. Seeds collected from cultivated sunflowers produce viable offspring, but plants grown outside areas of active Church worship gradually lose their holy properties over successive generations, reverting to mundane specimens.
## Properties and Applications
Sunflowers appear in alchemical preparations designed to provide protection against holy exposure, specifically when combined with grave dust. This pairing proves significant: the grave dust, associated with death and burial, appears to bridge or neutralize the sunflower's trace holy content in ways that make the resulting preparation suitable for vampiric use. The mechanism by which death-associated materials moderate holy properties warrants deeper alchemical investigation.

Perhaps most paradoxically, sunflowers serve as components in necromantic applications. Practitioners report successful creation of skeleton priests when sunflowers are combined with gem dust, despite the plant's holy associations. This convergence of holy-touched material and death magic presents a theoretical challenge. The grave dust interaction observed in holy resistance preparations may provide insight: materials strongly associated with death appear capable of bridging or neutralizing holy properties, enabling the plant's incorporation into necromantic workings.

Alchemists employ sunflowers in movement enhancement and magical recovery preparations, typically in combination with fire blossom and blood essence. These applications appear entirely unrelated to the plant's trace holy content, suggesting sunflowers possess multiple distinct properties. Whether these enhancement effects derive from nutritional content or separate magical characteristics remains unclear.

Horse trainers report improved speed and stamina when sunflowers are incorporated into feed. Given the plant's robust nutritional profile, these effects likely derive from conventional dietary benefit rather than magical properties, though the possibility of subtle enhancement cannot be dismissed entirely.
