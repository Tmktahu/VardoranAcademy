## Description and Habitat
Hell's clarion displays a distinctive dark trumpet or horn-shaped fruiting body, with flesh that ranges from deep charcoal to black. The interior of each trumpet glows with a dull red luminescence, creating an eerie appearance in the darkness where these fungi thrive. The mushrooms grow in clusters, their horn-like shapes resembling a chorus of instruments calling from the depths.

Hell's clarion grows exclusively in underground environments, particularly deep caves, abandoned tunnels, and subterranean chambers. The fungus demonstrates preference for areas with minimal light and high humidity. It is occasionally found growing around mantraps, suggesting some affinity for predatory or aggressive plant species.

The mushroom's infernal appearance and name reflect its strong association with chaos and unholy magic. The red glow emanating from within each fruiting body hints at the raw power contained in its flesh.
## Theories of Origin
The hell's clarion's exclusively subterranean growth and unholy associations suggest the fungus may have deep roots in Vardoran's history, potentially predating surface events. The mushroom's current properties demonstrate clear connections to chaos magic and primal aggression, though whether these traits are natural or the result of underground magical corruption remains uncertain.

The name "clarion" references the trumpet-like shape and may relate to the fungus serving as a herald or amplifier of aggressive impulses and unholy power. Some scholars theorize the mushroom channels or concentrates chaotic energies from the earth itself.
## Harvesting and Preparation
Mushrooms should be harvested when the red glow is most pronounced, as this indicates peak potency. The flesh is surprisingly firm despite its ominous appearance. Harvesting requires care to avoid damaging the delicate internal structure that produces the characteristic luminescence.

Fresh specimens maintain superior effectiveness. Dried mushrooms retain properties but with reduced potency. The mushrooms can be ground to powder, though this diminishes their effects. Spores can be collected for cultivation, though successfully growing hell's clarion requires carefully controlled underground conditions with minimal light exposure.
## Properties and Applications
Hell's clarion appears prominently in alchemical formulations designed to enhance physical combat capability. Practitioners who consume such preparations report significant increases in damage output, with concentrated mixtures apparently inducing rage-like states that further amplify destructive potential. The consistency of these effects across diverse preparation methods suggests the mushroom contains compounds fundamentally aligned with aggression and physical prowess.

Alchemists employ hell's clarion in preparations that provide protection against garlic exposure. This application sees particular use among vampiric populations and others vulnerable to garlic's effects. The mechanism by which an underground fungus associated with chaos magic counters garlic's properties remains unexplained, though the defensive quality appears as reliable as the mushroom's offensive applications.

The fungus features in unholy magical preparations, particularly those involving peak powers and primal force. Reports indicate hell's clarion enhances such workings when properly incorporated, though the specific techniques remain closely held by practitioners of chaos magic. When combined with snow flower and blood essence, the mushroom apparently produces vitality and healing effects, suggesting it amplifies aggressive or survival-oriented properties encountered in companion reagents rather than imposing singular effects.

Stable hands incorporating hell's clarion into horse feed report markedly improved acceleration in their charges. However, multiple handlers express concern about increased temperament during such feeding regimens, suggesting the mushroom's enhancement properties may carry behavioral side effects even in non-magical applications.
