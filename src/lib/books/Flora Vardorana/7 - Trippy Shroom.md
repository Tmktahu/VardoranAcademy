## Description and Habitat
The trippy shroom displays distinctive dark blue to purple coloration with bright magenta spots distributed across the cap surface. The mushroom grows in small clusters, typically emerging from decaying organic matter in shaded, damp conditions. Cap size varies from small buttons to dinner-plate specimens.

Trippy shrooms demonstrate remarkably broad distribution throughout Vardoran. The fungus appears in meadows, caves, forest clearings, and various other environments with suitable moisture and shade conditions. This wide range suggests highly adaptable species rather than specialized growth requirements. The mushroom shows no particular association with magical corruption or specific geographic features.

The trippy shroom's common name derives from its pronounced psychoactive effects rather than any unusual appearance or habitat preference.
## Theories of Origin
The trippy shroom appears to be a naturally occurring native species predating human or vampiric settlement. The fungus demonstrates no signs of magical enhancement or corruption-based mutation. Its psychoactive properties likely evolved as defensive mechanism, discouraging consumption by producing disorienting effects in would-be predators.

The mushroom's widespread distribution and lack of specialized habitat requirements suggest ancient lineage well-adapted to Vardoran's various ecosystems. Unlike many documented species, trippy shroom shows no connection to major historical events, magical catastrophes, or intentional cultivation.
## Harvesting and Preparation
Harvest carefully to avoid accidental consumption through skin contact with damaged specimens. Fresh mushrooms contain highest concentration of active compounds. The fungus requires minimal preparation for consumption, though cooking reduces potency significantly.

Dried specimens maintain psychoactive properties for extended periods when stored properly. Grinding to powder concentrates effects but makes dosage control more difficult. Spores collected from mature specimens produce reliable growth in suitable environments.
## Properties and Applications
Consumption of trippy shroom produces powerful psychoactive effects. Multiple documented cases describe pronounced visual distortion, with subjects reporting warped perception, enhanced color intensity, and altered spatial awareness. The intensity varies considerably based on dosage and individual tolerance, though duration appears remarkably consistent at approximately 45 minutes regardless of intake amount.

Recreational consumption occurs throughout Vardoran despite the mushroom's intense effects. Users deliberately seek trippy shroom for the perception-altering experience itself, suggesting the effects, while disorienting, lack the danger or unpleasantness that typically discourage substance use. Such consumption carries documented risks: disorientation-related accidents and impaired judgment during the effect period appear common enough to warrant caution.

Notably, trippy shroom demonstrates no apparent utility in traditional alchemical preparations or enhancement formulations. Unlike most documented species where alchemists employ the plant across diverse applications, trippy shroom's value appears confined exclusively to direct consumption for perception alteration. This limited application range suggests the mushroom's psychoactive compounds either degrade during processing or fail to transfer desirable effects through prepared formulations.

Trippy shroom extracts form the active component in Protocol 10: Anesthetic Draught. Controlled dosing produces sensory disruption sufficient for pain management without complete incapacitation. Efficacy tested across 47 subjects with consistent results.

Dosage parameters: 15-20mg dried mushroom per 70kg body mass produces adequate analgesia for minor procedures. 25-30mg range suitable for moderate pain management. Doses exceeding 40mg produce excessive disorientation unsuitable for functional use.

Onset occurs within 8-12 minutes of oral administration. Peak analgesic effect manifests at 15-20 minute mark. Duration maintains therapeutic window for approximately 40-45 minutes before rapid decline.

Preparation method: Fresh specimens dried at low temperature (below 40°C) to preserve active compounds. Grind to fine powder. Suspend in neutral carrier solution immediately before administration. Powder degrades within 72 hours of grinding; prepare fresh batches as needed.

Side effects: Visual distortion occurs in 100% of subjects at therapeutic doses. Spatial disorientation reported in 68% of cases. Nausea in 12% of subjects. One case of sustained disorientation lasting 90 minutes (subject mass 52kg, received 30mg dose - dosage calculation error).

Contraindications: Avoid use in subjects requiring precise motor control or spatial awareness. Not suitable for major surgical procedures requiring extended anesthesia duration. Ineffective for neuropathic pain conditions.

Note: Psychoactive effects make this unsuitable as primary anesthetic. Reserve for cases where conventional pain management proves insufficient and brief procedure duration permits 45-minute therapeutic window.
