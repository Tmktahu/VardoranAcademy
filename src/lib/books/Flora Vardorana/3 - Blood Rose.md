## Description and Habitat
The blood rose is distinguished by its deep crimson petals and unusually dark foliage. The stem bears prominent thorns that appear almost black, harder and sharper than those of common roses. Long thorned vines trail from the base of the plant, creating a protective barrier around the roots. Unlike ordinary roses, the petals maintain their rich color even when dried, and fresh blooms possess a faint metallic scent reminiscent of iron. The plant thrives in soil with high mineral content, particularly iron-rich earth, and grows most vigorously in areas with partial shade. Full sun exposure causes the petals to lose potency.

The plant is hardy and requires little maintenance once established, though it demonstrates unusual sensitivity to its growing environment... flowers grown in depleted soil produce weaker extracts.
## Theories of Origin
The blood rose's peculiar properties have led to speculation about its origins. Some scholars theorize the plant emerged following the War of Dracula, when his defeat resulted in widespread blood rain that saturated Vardoran's soil. This event may have warped ordinary roses through prolonged exposure to concentrated blood essence, fundamentally altering their nature.

This theory would explain the plant's affinity for iron-rich soil and its unusual therapeutic properties. Whether blood roses existed before the blood rain or represent an entirely new species remains uncertain.
## Harvesting and Preparation
Mature petals should be harvested when essential oils are most concentrated. Handle carefully, as bruised petals lose therapeutic properties rapidly. For distillation, process immediately using low heat to preserve active compounds. The extraction requires maintaining specific temperature and pH conditions, as the regenerative compounds degrade if exposed to excessive heat or acidic environments.

Petals may also be dried and ground to pollen for use in various preparations, though this reduces overall potency. Fresh distillate produces the most effective results.
## Properties and Applications
Blood rose extract appears extensively in healing preparations throughout Vardoran. Healers and alchemists employ the distillate for treating both minor injuries and severe trauma, with consistent reports of accelerated tissue repair. The plant's regenerative properties appear remarkably powerful, encouraging cellular repair at rates significantly exceeding natural healing. Water-based brews serve for general healing purposes, while concentrated potions address severe injuries requiring rapid intervention.

The distillate serves as base component for numerous alchemical compounds, suggesting broad compatibility with various reagents and preparations. This versatility likely derives from the plant's fundamental regenerative properties rather than specific magical affinities.

Combinations of blood rose with mourning lily appear in formulations designed to provide solar protection. This pairing sees particular use among those with sunlight sensitivity, though the mechanism by which these two plants interact to produce such effects remains unclear. Some alchemical theories suggest blood rose's life-affirming properties balance mourning lily's death affinity, creating a protective middle ground.

Reports from vampiric practitioners indicate blood rose enhances magical efficiency when combined with bleeding heart and blood essence. Such preparations apparently improve spell effectiveness and energy recovery, though investigation into these claims proves challenging given the specialized nature of vampiric magic.

Perhaps most curiously, blood roses feature in necromantic practices, specifically in rituals for animating skeletal remains. This application stands in apparent contradiction to the plant's healing properties. The ability to both restore living tissue and empower dead matter suggests blood rose operates at the fundamental boundary between life and death, though such theoretical frameworks require substantial additional study to confirm.

Blood rose distillate forms the active regenerative component in multiple established protocols and constructs. Primary medical application: Protocol 07 (Emery-Bloodrose Suspension) for venom sap neutralization. Crushed emery ore suspended in high-grade bloodrose distillate (minimum 80% active extract) produces violent localized tissue purging followed by immediate regenerative response. Distillate concentration critical: below 80% potency produces incomplete regeneration.

Preparation specifications: Extract from mature petals under low heat. Filter and reduce to concentrate. Stabilize with 10% neutral spirit for consistency. Shelf life extends to 14 days when properly sealed.

Secondary medical application: Protocol 08 (Coldpress Clotting Compound) hemostasis treatment. Bloodrose distillate serves as regenerative carrier for snow flower vasoconstrictive agent. Blend ratio: 2 parts bloodrose distillate to 1 part snow flower extract. Cotton fiber matrix saturated with mixture produces rapid clotting when applied to bleeding sites. Combination initiates soft tissue closure around forming clot.

Alchemical application: Construct 05 (Rejuvenation Juice) therapeutic impact healing compound. Concentrated blood rose extract provides primary healing essence. Combined with blood essence amplifier and venom sap delivery mechanism. Formula creates area-of-effect healing agent suitable for thrown deployment. Impact activation triggers rapid dispersion of healing matrix. Compound adheres to living tissue and absorbs quickly, providing healing effects comparable to direct potion consumption. Storage stability indefinite when properly sealed.

Critical observation: Blood rose distillate demonstrates non-selective regenerative effects. Compound heals both corrupted and healthy tissue indiscriminately. In Protocol 07 applications, emery ore provides selectivity by reacting specifically with venom sap compounds. Without selective agent, distillate will regenerate damaged tissue regardless of contamination state.

Tested across 15+ subjects in medical protocols with consistent efficacy. Construct 05 formula sourced from Venom Blade Alchemist. No adverse reactions to distillate itself documented. Complications arise from improper concentration or contaminated source material.
