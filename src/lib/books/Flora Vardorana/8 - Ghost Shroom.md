## Description and Habitat
The ghost shroom displays a distinctive translucent appearance, with pale blue to teal coloring that gives the fungus an ethereal, ghostly quality. The fruiting bodies range from small caps on thin stalks to larger trumpet-shaped specimens, all sharing the characteristic semi-transparent flesh that seems to capture and diffuse light. The mushrooms emit a faint luminescence, creating an eerie glow in the darkness of their forest home.

Ghost shrooms grow exclusively within the Cursed Forest, particularly in areas of dense fog and shadow. The fungus demonstrates highest concentration within the Lair of the Behemoth. Witches dwelling in forest huts frequently possess specimens, suggesting knowledge of the mushroom's properties or cultivation techniques.

Curiously, ghost shrooms can be extracted from cursed wood through careful processing, as if the fungus exists in latent form within the corrupted timber itself. This unusual property suggests the mushroom may be as much a manifestation of the forest's curse as it is a conventional organism.
## Theories of Origin
The ghost shroom's exclusive presence in the Cursed Forest and its extraction from cursed wood suggest the fungus emerged as a direct result of whatever magical catastrophe created the forest's current state. Whether the mushrooms grew naturally after the curse or manifested from the curse itself remains uncertain.

The ethereal, translucent nature of the fungus and its strong association with illusion magic hint at its connection to the boundary between reality and perception. Some scholars theorize ghost shrooms serve as physical anchors for the illusions that permeate the Cursed Forest.
## Harvesting and Preparation
Mushrooms should be harvested when displaying peak luminescence and translucency, as this indicates maximum potency. The delicate, semi-transparent flesh requires extremely gentle handling to avoid damage. Harvesting in the Cursed Forest requires caution due to vision-obscuring fog and the forest's other hazards.

Fresh specimens maintain superior properties, particularly for applications involving perception and illusion. The mushrooms can be processed into ghost yarn when combined with wool and cotton, creating fabric with unusual properties. Dried specimens retain some effectiveness but lose the characteristic translucency. The mushrooms can be ground to pollen, though this diminishes their magical properties. Spores can be collected for cultivation, though successfully growing ghost shrooms outside the Cursed Forest proves difficult.
## Properties and Applications
Ghost shroom appears extensively in formulations designed to counter vision-obscuring effects. Garments incorporating ghost shroom-derived materials apparently provide remarkable clarity of sight even in dense fog conditions, with particular efficacy against the vision-blocking mists that plague the Cursed Forest. Multiple accounts from forest travelers confirm these effects, suggesting the mushroom's translucent nature somehow translates into perception enhancement when properly prepared.

The mushroom's semi-transparent flesh can be processed into ghost yarn through combination with wool and cotton. Fabric woven from such materials demonstrates unusual properties, creating textiles that appear to blend material and immaterial qualities. Illusionists and those working with subtle visual effects employ these fabrics in applications requiring misdirection or ethereal aesthetics. The specific techniques for producing ghost yarn appear closely held by experienced weavers.

Alchemical preparations combining ghost shroom with fire blossom and blood essence apparently enhance attack speed and weapon effectiveness. This application seems paradoxical given the mushroom's ethereal nature, though practitioners suggest the combination may manipulate perception of time or movement rather than providing direct physical enhancement. The mechanisms remain unclear but warrant investigation into how perception-affecting properties might translate to combat applications.

The ghost shroom's natural luminescence finds use in decorative applications where its eerie glow serves both practical and aesthetic purposes. Unlike conventional light sources, the mushroom's glow appears particularly suited to creating atmospheric effects without harsh illumination.
