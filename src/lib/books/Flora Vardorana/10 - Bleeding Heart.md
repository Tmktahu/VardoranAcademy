# Bleeding Heart: *Dicentra Cruenta*
**Series:** Flora Vardorana: A Comprehensive Study, Volume X

## Description and Habitat
The bleeding heart displays distinctive drooping bell-shaped flowers in deep pink to blood-red hues, with pale white tips at the base of each bloom. The flowers hang in clusters from curved stems, creating the appearance of blood dripping from open wounds. Large dark green leaves grow in spreading clusters at the base of the plant.

Bleeding hearts grow exclusively in the Ruins of Mortium, a barren cold wasteland in eastern Vardoran. The plants demonstrate remarkable hardiness, thriving in frozen soil where few other species survive. The region serves as stronghold for Noctum's remaining forces, where shadow rifts pierce the veil between worlds. The plant's exclusive presence in this shadow-touched wasteland suggests fundamental connection to the forces that permeate the region.

The bleeding heart's ability to flourish where shadow magic saturates the land marks it as inherently tied to both vampiric essence and shadow realm energies.
## Theories of Origin
The bleeding heart's exclusive growth in Mortium suggests the plant either predates Dracula's conquest and adapted to the region's transformation, or emerged as a direct result of the shadow corruption that saturates the area. The blood rain that fell across Vardoran after Dracula's defeat would have interacted with Mortium's already corrupted soil and persistent shadow magic, potentially creating or enhancing the plant's vampiric properties through this unique combination.

Some scholars theorize bleeding hearts serve as a bridge between the physical world and the shadow realm, drawing sustenance from the rifts that Noctum forces maintain. The plant's blood-red coloring and association with life-draining effects support theories of deep vampiric influence.
## Harvesting and Preparation
Flowers should be harvested when fully formed and displaying peak coloration, as this indicates maximum potency. The drooping blooms are delicate despite the plant's hardiness in frozen conditions. Harvesting in Mortium requires caution due to the region's hostile inhabitants and unpredictable shadow rift activity.

Fresh flowers yield superior results in vampiric applications. Dried flowers maintain effectiveness but with reduced potency. The flowers can be ground to pollen, though this significantly diminishes their properties. Seeds can be collected from mature plants, though cultivation outside Mortium proves extremely difficult due to the plant's apparent dependence on shadow-saturated soil.
## Properties and Applications
Bleeding heart appears extensively in formulations designed to enhance life-draining capabilities. The plant features prominently in elixirs that reportedly improve vitality theft through both physical and magical means, with users claiming enhanced weapon-based and spell-based life leech effectiveness. The consistency of these applications across diverse practitioners suggests the plant possesses fundamental properties aligned with vampiric energy manipulation, likely derived from sustained exposure to shadow magic and blood essence in Mortium's corrupted environment.

Alchemical preparations combining bleeding heart with blood rose and blood essence apparently produce effects focused on spell efficiency and magical energy drain. Practitioners report improved spell power and enhanced energy recovery when consuming such formulations. Alternative combinations employing mourning lily and blood essence instead reportedly enhance weapon effectiveness and physical vitality theft, demonstrating the plant's versatility across different life-draining applications.

Perhaps unexpectedly, horse trainers incorporating bleeding heart into feed report improved acceleration in their charges. This application seems paradoxical given the plant's strong vampiric associations, suggesting the presence of invigorating properties that operate independently of the life-draining characteristics. Whether these represent distinct compounds within the plant or different manifestations of the same underlying properties warrants investigation.
