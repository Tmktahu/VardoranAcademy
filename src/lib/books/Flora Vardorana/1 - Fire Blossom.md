## Description and Habitat
The fire blossom displays distinctive golden to orange star-shaped flowers, typically with five to six petals arranged around a darker amber center. The blooms grow on tall stems rising from clusters of bright green leaves. Multiple flowers emerge from each plant, often growing in patches where conditions prove favorable.

The flowers are notably warm to the touch, radiating gentle heat even in cool conditions. This persistent warmth marks the plant's magical nature and its inherent affinity with fire magic. In this regard, fire blossoms serve as a direct counterpart to snow flowers, embodying opposing elemental properties.

Fire blossoms thrive in temperate woodlands and open farmlands, favoring well-drained soil with good sun exposure. The plants demonstrate particular vigor in areas that receive sustained sunlight throughout the growing period.
## Theories of Origin
The fire blossom's widespread distribution suggests it may predate Dracula's conquest. The plant's inherent fire magic affinity appears to be a fundamental aspect of its nature rather than a recent development.

The plant's name derives from its inherent connection to fire magic and the characteristic warmth that emanates from its petals.
## Harvesting and Preparation
Flowers should be harvested when fully opened, as immature blooms contain lower concentrations of active compounds. The persistent warmth radiating from the petals does not affect their delicate structure, though care must still be taken to avoid bruising during collection.

For incendiary applications, fire blossom requires careful distillation to concentrate active compounds. This distillation must occur in controlled conditions when preparing volatile compounds. For general alchemical use, fresh flowers produce superior results, though dried flowers retain functional properties. The flowers can be ground to pollen, though this significantly reduces their effectiveness. Seeds can be collected from mature plants for cultivation.
## Properties and Applications
Fire blossom appears frequently in alchemical preparations intended to provide fire resistance. The plant's consistent use across multiple such formulations suggests it contains stable compounds that interact beneficially with thermal exposure. The inherent warmth observable in fresh petals likely correlates to these protective properties, though the precise mechanism remains unclear without deeper alchemical study.

Alchemists employ fire blossom in various enhancement preparations, particularly those focused on physical performance and movement. Observations of subjects consuming such preparations reveal improvements in speed, agility, and sustained effort capacity. The plant's fire magic affinity appears to provide invigorating effects, though whether this derives from thermal properties or other magical characteristics warrants further investigation.

Concentrated fire blossom preparations - often distilled into spirits - see regular use among those requiring sustained physical exertion. Horse trainers and mounted warriors report particular benefit from these applications. Horses given fire blossom-enhanced feed demonstrate measurably improved speed and stamina, suggesting the plant's effects extend beyond simple dietary nutrition.

Combinations of fire blossom with various other reagents produce distinct effects depending on the accompanying materials. Common applications include weapon enhancement preparations and magical recovery compounds. The plant's fire affinity appears to complement certain other magical properties while remaining inert with others, a pattern that suggests specific interaction mechanisms rather than general enhancement.

Fire blossom extract serves as thermal energy source in Construct 03: Liquid Fire incendiary device. Plant contains dormant thermal energy in stable form. Careful distillation concentrates active compounds without triggering premature combustion. Distillation must occur in completely oxygen-free environment when preparing volatile compounds.

Formulation specifications: Fire blossom (processed extract) combined with venom sap and mutant grease. Venom sap's reality-warping properties destabilize fire blossom's contained thermal energy, creating ignition mechanism. When exposed to venom sap's warping effects, fire blossom releases fiery essence. Mutant grease accelerant amplifies reaction into intense, spreading flames.

Combination becomes air-reactive. Any air exposure triggers immediate combustion. All mixing must occur in sealed, oxygen-free environment. Transfer to deployment containers while maintaining air-tight seal.

Upon air exposure during deployment, venom sap destabilizes fire blossom's thermal energy, creating immediate ignition. Mutant grease ensures continued combustion even on wet or treated surfaces. Flames adhere to surfaces and burn for extended duration.

Formula sourced from Venom Blade Alchemist. Tested in controlled deployment scenarios. Effective area-denial weapon. Storage stability indefinite when properly sealed. No degradation of reactive properties observed in sealed samples after extended periods.
