## Description and Habitat
The mourning lily displays distinctive drooping bell-shaped flowers in pale blue to teal hues, hanging downward from gracefully curved stems. The blooms possess a mournful, weighted appearance, as if bowing in perpetual grief. Dark green leaves grow along the stems, providing contrast to the delicate flowers.

Mourning lilies naturally grow in darkness and shadow, particularly in graveyards and burial sites where sunlight rarely penetrates. The plants demonstrate unusual vigor in soil enriched by decomposition, thriving where other flowers struggle. While they can survive in sunlight, growth is notably slower and the plants remain stunted compared to those cultivated in darkness. This strong preference for shadow marks them as fundamentally opposed to solar forces.

The plant's exclusive growth in shadowed consecrated ground and its association with death magic mark it as inherently connected to necromantic energies. Whether this represents active absorption of such forces or simple environmental preference remains debated.
## Theories of Origin
The mourning lily's exclusive growth in burial sites suggests a deep connection to death and the boundary between life and the grave. Some scholars theorize the plant predates Dracula's conquest, serving as a natural bridge between the living world and the realm of the dead. Others propose the blood rain enhanced pre-existing necromantic properties, intensifying the plant's affinity for consecrated ground.

The plant's name reflects both its appearance and its association with mourning and death rites. Whether mourning lilies originally grew elsewhere and adapted to graveyards, or have always been creatures of burial ground, remains uncertain.
## Harvesting and Preparation
Flowers should be harvested when fully formed and drooping, as this indicates peak potency. The delicate bell-shaped blooms bruise easily and should be handled with care. Harvesting from active burial sites requires appropriate permissions and respect for consecrated ground.

Unlike most alchemical plants, mourning lily demonstrates unusual behavior regarding freshness. The flowers actually increase in necromantic potency as they wither and die, as if drawing power from their own demise. Recently deceased flowers yield superior results for death-related applications compared to fresh blooms. This property aligns with the plant's fundamental connection to death magic. The flowers can be ground to pollen, though this significantly diminishes their magical properties. Seeds can be collected from mature plants for cultivation, though they require grave soil or similar conditions to germinate successfully.
## Properties and Applications
Mourning lily appears extensively in necromantic applications throughout Vardoran. Practitioners employ the plant as a key component when animating ghouls, and it features prominently in gravedigger spell enhancements. The consistency of these applications across diverse necromantic traditions suggests the plant possesses fundamental affinities for death magic rather than simply growing in locations associated with death. The plant's preference for burial grounds may reflect these inherent properties rather than cause them.

Alchemists combine mourning lily with blood rose in formulations designed to provide sun resistance. The pairing apparently proves effective for those with solar sensitivity, with practitioners suggesting the mourning lily's shadow affinity somehow balances or complements blood rose's vampiric properties. The mechanism by which a shadow-dwelling plant contributes to solar protection warrants further investigation, though the reliability of these preparations appears well-established.

Preparations incorporating mourning lily apparently enhance life-draining effects. Users of such formulations report improvements in weapon-based vitality theft and recovery capabilities. When combined with various other reagents, the plant contributes to effects ranging from enhanced precision to improved combat effectiveness, suggesting multiple potential applications beyond pure necromancy.

Perhaps most surprisingly, horse trainers incorporating mourning lily into feed report notable improvements in agility and pivoting response. The mechanism behind this enhancement remains unclear given the plant's strong necromantic associations. Whether the effect derives from death magic properties, conventional nutritional content, or some entirely unrelated characteristic represents an open question.

Mourning lily extract serves as sedation and reflexive suppression component in Protocol 10: Trifold Anesthetic Draught. Plant demonstrates magically-attuned connection to death, property exploited for inducing unconsciousness during medical procedures. Boiled flowers yield oils that deepen sedation and reduce reflexive response.

Formulation specifications: 1 part snow flower, 2 parts trippy shroom to vessel with warm base liquid. Add mourning lily extract dropwise. Steep uncovered 7 minutes. Strain and bottle in light-blocking vial. Use within 72 hours.

Dosage for induced unconsciousness: 30-40mL oral administration. Drowsiness onset 3-5 minutes. Unconsciousness manifests 8-10 minutes post-ingestion. Subject enters deep, non-restful unconscious state. Pulse and respiration remain steady. Muscle slack observed. Duration approximately 35-40 minutes before natural recovery.

Local injection application: 0.5-1.0mL subdermal near treatment site produces effective numbness without sedation. Onset 30-90 seconds. Reapply every 15 minutes as needed. Avoid vascular or spinal injection.

Mourning lily component specifically responsible for reflexive suppression and consciousness depression. Snow flower provides nerve dulling. Trippy shroom produces visual distortion and disorientation. Combined effect permits surgical intervention on conscious-resistant subjects.

Tested on self with 40mL dose: complete unconsciousness 8 minutes post-ingestion, no memory of external stimuli during effect period, mild disorientation upon waking 35 minutes later. Subsequent tests across 8 subjects demonstrate consistent results. High doses (>50mL) may prolong unconsciousness beyond safe window. Nausea reported in fasted subjects.
