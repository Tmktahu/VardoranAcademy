## Description and Habitat
Corrupted flower specimens display consistent morphology: vibrant magenta to purple petals emitting measurable luminescence (approximately 2-3 lumens at peak), emerging from dark teal bases. Coloration remains stable post-harvest for 6-8 hours before degradation. Petal structure shows cellular disruption consistent with venom sap exposure. Grows in clustered formations where corruption density exceeds threshold levels.

Distribution limited to Oakveil Woodlands territory controlled by Venom Blades faction. Growth correlates directly with venom sap saturation in soil. Plant does not occur in uncorrupted areas. Cultivation requires maintained corruption levels; cleansed soil produces zero viable growth.

This is not a natural species. Corrupted flower represents induced mutation of pre-existing Oakveil flora through systematic venom sap corruption implemented by Venom Blades forces under Megara's direction.
## Theories of Origin
Origin is not theoretical. Corrupted flower emerged following Venom Blades occupation of Oakveil and subsequent deliberate corruption of local ecosystem. Timeline places first specimens within months of initial corruption events. Plant represents either: (a) rapid mutation of native flora under extreme corruption exposure, or (b) intentional cultivation by Venom Blades alchemists.

Evidence suggests option (a) more probable. Alchemical utility appears coincidental rather than designed. Multiple plant species in Oakveil show similar corruption-induced changes; corrupted flower simply proved most stable and useful.
## Harvesting and Preparation
Harvest at peak luminescence for maximum potency. Handle with treated gloves; fresh specimens cause contact dermatitis in 73% of subjects tested. Petals degrade rapidly once separated from corrupted soil substrate. Optimal processing window: 4-6 hours post-harvest.

Fresh specimens required for coating applications. Drying reduces efficacy by approximately 60%. Grinding to powder decreases potency further. Seed viability depends on corruption maintenance in growing medium; standard soil produces zero germination.
## Properties and Applications
Primary application: weapon coating synthesis across multiple magical schools. Combined with venom sap produces useful substances for coating weapons. Additional reagent combinations yield blood, chaos, frost, illusion, storm, and unholy variants. Cross-school versatility unprecedented among documented flora. Corruption appears to render plant magically receptive rather than magically attuned, functioning as blank substrate for imposed enchantments.

Secondary application: spell critical enhancement when combined with plague brier and blood essence. Mechanism unclear but repeatable. Observed effects: increase in precision strike frequency, increase in strike impact magnitude in controlled tests.

Note: Utility exists despite unnatural origin. Corrupted flower provides practical enchantment base unavailable from natural sources. Recommend continued harvesting from Venom Blades territory despite ethical concerns regarding corruption-derived materials.
