The Dominion of Nexarca was not a land one simply wandered into, for even its winds seemed measured by some unseen logic that analyzed every dust plume as if it were a test result, and the Gilded Compass learned this truth before they had even crossed the first border. Their vessels glided along the pale metallic canals that traced the surface of Nexarca’s eastern provinces like surgical incisions, each waterway reflecting the grey spires that rose around them like grave markers made of polished steel. At every shore station, austere figures in monochromatic uniforms recorded their presence with devices that clicked and whirred, treating the arrivals not as guests, but as variables entering a controlled experiment whose parameters they had not been briefed on. The journey alone made it abundantly clear that Nexarca did not welcome the uncertain, and that the return of magic had made these lands even less forgiving than rumor had suggested.

When the travelers from the Gilded Compass finally disembarked at the port-city of Iserith Gate, they expected interrogation, but they did not expect the eerie silence with which it unfolded, for the officials who met them asked no questions with their mouths but instead scanned them with ochre lenses that projected thin beams of light which translated their vital signs directly into data-slates. The warriors—those proud, seasoned individuals who had carved legacies in Mont Marie and Veltraxis—stood unusually still as machines measured their pulse, their mana concentrations, and even their skeletal density, while the officers observed with academic detachment that bordered on disinterest. Dontrix, who served both as healer and scholar among them, stared at the equipment with unmistakable intrigue, for he recognized fragments of technomantic grafting embedded in handheld instruments and muttered that such hybridization between necromancy and machinery should not exist outside controlled laboratories, and yet here it stood in casual use. The reception felt less like a border crossing and more like admission into a clinic, and the Dominion officers stamped their documents with the quiet finality of bureaucrats who did not care whether the patient survived the diagnosis.

The Gilded Compass had come to Nexarca with a clear mission, for they sought knowledge of the Dominion’s victories over the Dreughardt Empire and wished to either forge alliance or gather insight that might one day aid their struggle against Luminance, Solarus, and whatever remnants of the Imperial faith still stalked the continents. However, Nexarca’s rulers viewed diplomacy as a formality and offered neither hospitality nor hostility, but instead the cool neutrality of a nation that analyzed all things according to measurable value and found little about the Compass that warranted investment. Their first petitions for temporary settlement were rejected without venom or argument, but with the simple explanation that foreign organizations represented high variables which introduced undesirable fluctuations to the Dominion’s internal equilibrium. Even the rejection itself impressed the Compass, for it was delivered without arrogance, merely as a statement of logic, and in that moment they learned that pride was not the Dominion’s sin—indifference was.

Yet if Nexarca would not host them, it would certainly test them, for the Compass found the streets of Virelic Spire—the Dominion’s reconstructed capital—full of hazards that did not resemble dangers in any other part of the world. The group encountered automaton sentinels who monitored the flow of pedestrians and emitted stunning pulses when crowds grew dense enough to risk “efficiency failure events,” and Lady Kaela nearly collapsed when one such Construct assessed her enchanted bracers as unstable magical anomalies and demanded immediate surrender of the artifacts for confiscation. Sir Tavik argued fiercely that the bracers were irreplaceable heirlooms tied to their mission, yet the Construct processed his objections as irrelevant noise until Lady Seren intervened and produced papers Dontrix had insisted they obtain at the border, which confirmed that their artifacts had been cleared for temporary usage. The Construct accepted the documents, withdrew without further action, and Tavik muttered through gritted teeth that he would rather fight a living army than negotiate with machines that had no concept of fear or compromise.

The true obstacle emerged several days later when the Entropy Directorate accused the Compass of harboring unregistered magic within their ranks, citing readings that indicated residual mana outputs from Sir Berin and Lady Nimara during a brief skirmish with street thieves. To the Directorate, the moral context of the act—defending themselves against assailants—was insignificant compared to the fact that unlicensed magic had been deployed in a region that still suffered occasional Weave distortions from prior wartime experimentation. Armed officials in white coats and sigil-marked respirators escorted Berin and Nimara to a cold observation hall lined with surgical glass and technomantic restraints, where they were informed with sterile politeness that all magical emissions must be quantified and categorized according to a scale most of them had never even heard of. Sir Maelrik demanded their release and nearly reached for his sword, but Dontrix seized his arm and whispered that they would only escalate matters if they introduced aggression in a nation where even violence must submit to procedural evaluation.

Their negotiations for release proved grueling, for the Dominion did not respond to appeals of honor, compassion, or diplomacy, but only to the presentation of useful data, and Dontrix swiftly became the lynchpin that kept the situation from spiraling into disaster. He examined the Directorate’s equipment and provided detailed commentary on magical physiology, demonstrating that Berin’s mana output originated from a hereditary channeling pattern rather than post-Weave mutation, and that Nimara’s abilities were alchemical rather than arcane in source. The Directorate recorded these explanations with genuine interest and even allowed Dontrix to observe their testing apparatus, which he described later as a horrifying marvel that used necrotic nerve conduction to simulate spell ignition through cadaveric tissue. By proving himself an intellectual asset rather than a political or magical threat, Dontrix secured the safe return of his companions, and although no one thanked him loudly, the relief was palpable when Berin and Nimara walked out without implants or data tags drilled into their spines.

However, earning the freedom of two comrades did not change Nexarca’s overarching verdict regarding long-term presence, for the Dominion concluded that the Compass posed unacceptable research interference risks and thus could not be granted territory for encampment, embassy, or base of any kind. They were not driven out with soldiers or shamed before crowds, but instead invited to depart at their earliest convenience, a phrasing that sounded almost courteous until one considered that the Dominion rarely disguised its true meaning beneath pleasantries. Their departure window was accompanied by strict patrol schedules, restricted access corridors, and a requirement that all Compass members undergo final biometric audits to ensure that no Dominion property, biological or mechanical, traveled with them. Lady Seren muttered that she almost preferred the brutality of the Dreughardt Empire, for at least cruelty was recognizable, whereas Nexarca treated all living beings—including themselves—as little more than transient equations.

Yet even if they had been denied a base, they had not been denied purpose, for the Compass managed to leave Nexarca with information of immeasurable value, and it came not through diplomacy but through contact with those who had survived the Dominion’s war against the Empire. One night, in a dim manu-factorum tavern where chem-lamps flickered behind grated steel mesh, Sir Edran spoke with a machinist whose arms were grafted with necrotic servo-tendons, and who remembered the wars not as cycles of data but as years of shrieking metal and burning flesh. He described the horrors of the Technonecrotic Infantry and the even more terrible Siege Beasts, and then uttered, with haunted reverence, that the Dominion won not because of machines but because they understood that death had no sanctity and therefore could be bent just as easily as iron. Edran listened without interrupting, for he knew that such truths were invaluable to any faction that might one day find itself between Nexarca’s logic and someone else’s zeal, and he stored the machinist’s words with the solemn care of a historian who knew that memory itself was a battlefield.

The Compass also learned of the Continuity Protocol, which decentralized the Dominion’s critical functions across multiple regions so that no single failure could collapse the entire system as it had during the death of Empress Elidra. Dontrix practically vibrated with scholarly wonder when he heard that governance had been converted into distributed logic cores, and Lady Kaela remarked that a nation which dismantled its own hierarchy to preserve stability was more terrifying than any empire that simply enforced obedience through blades and scripture. From street vendors, factory workers, and overseers they gradually assembled a picture of Nexarca as a nation incapable of compromise because it had engineered its society to operate without sentiment, and therefore could neither be inspired nor persuaded by promises that concerned emotion or morality. In that realization the Compass found both the reason for their rejection and the key to future understanding, for Nexarca did not refuse them out of hostility but out of a cold calculation that any foreign base would introduce uncertainty into a system built to crush uncertainty wherever it arose.

When the Compass finally departed from Nexarca’s shores, they did so without banners or fanfare, and the Dominion recorded their exit with the same dispassionate precision with which it had measured their entry. The group stood upon the deck of their vessel as the grey spires receded into the smog-thick horizon, and Sir Tavik exhaled through clenched teeth that he would rather storm a fortress of zealots than endure another conversation with a Directorate official who considered the soul a redundant organ. Yet despite their frustrations, the Compass understood that their visit had not been a failure, for information was a resource as vital as territory, and the Dominion had provided knowledge that no scholar outside its borders would have ever surrendered willingly. In denying them a home, Nexarca had given them insight, and there were moments when denial became a greater gift than acceptance.

They traveled west with the weary satisfaction of those who had survived a trial without fully comprehending its nature, and they carried with them an expanding map of alliances, resistances, and unknowns that stretched across continents like the veins of some vast sleeping creature. Their path would eventually lead them back into conflict with forces both holy and malignant, and one day they would speak the name Nexarca with caution, for they understood now that the Dominion did not sleep, it merely observed, and its silence hid ambitions that could reshape civilizations if ever unleashed again. In the years to come, many would ask why the Gilded Compass never established a base in the Technocratic Dominion of Nexarca, and the truthful answer would always be: because Nexarca did not permit variables it could not predict, and the Gilded Compass had always been a force of living uncertainty.
