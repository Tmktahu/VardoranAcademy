Five hundred and twenty-seven years after the death of Amadeus, the Gilded Compass turned its attention to the fragmented lands of Veltraxis, a republic recently reshaped by conquest and still smoldering from the fires lit by the Empire of Dreughardt. For generations prior, Veltraxis had been regarded as a bastion of arcanists, inventors, and philosophers—an intellectual powerhouse whose glass-forged cities and aqueduct-fed gardens stood as symbols of rational governance and civic pride. However, by the time the Compass approached, that identity had been forcefully rewritten through imperial decree, leaving behind a divided territory split between an Eastern Protectorate bathed in disciplined marble facades and the Western Ashlands where the remnants of Veltraxis’s old soul wandered half-buried in their own ruin. The Gilded Compass did not arrive as conquerors, liberators, or saboteurs, but as cautious observers seeking footholds in lands where magic had once flourished and now lingered like a wounded animal awaiting either mercy or slaughter.

From the outset, Veltraxis presented a unique problem for the Compass because its populace had been shaped by two incompatible traumas: the trauma of knowledge severed violently from its practitioners and the trauma of obedience imposed through enforced ignorance. The Compass found that speaking of cooperation between humans and vampires elicited vastly different reactions depending on location, with Protectorate citizens recoiling not out of fear but out of conditioned disgust, while those in the Ashlands responded with weary curiosity born of desperation. This division complicated recruitment efforts, as the faction could not rely on shared cultural memory or collective pain to form bonds; instead, it had to navigate a terrain where one half of the population had been taught to despise the other half, and both halves had been taught to distrust outsiders entirely. Despite these barriers, the Compass persisted because Veltraxis represented something rare in a world fractured by conquest: a place where the population had not forgotten how to learn, even if the Empire had made the act of learning itself a crime punishable by mutilation or death.

The Eastern Protectorate was the first portion of Veltraxis that the Compass attempted to infiltrate, largely because its structured environment provided predictable systems of governance, bureaucracy, and oversight that could be manipulated over time. On the surface, the Protectorate shone with imperial efficiency, featuring straight-lined streets adorned with statues of Empress Vanessa Dreughardt, meticulously paved roads that connected administrative hubs, and institutions of higher learning repurposed into military academies where loyalty to the iron flame was graded alongside mathematics and marching drills. Beneath this orderly facade lay a citizenry stripped of agency, whose children memorized revised histories in which Veltraxis had always been destined to serve Dreughardt and whose scholars repeated state propaganda under the watchful eyes of clerical censors. In this environment, the Compass learned quickly that infiltration required total compliance with imperial performative loyalty, leading its agents to adopt false identities as merchants, medical surveyors, engineers, and itinerant clerks assigned to assess infrastructure projects rather than be noticed as ideological irregularities.

Prince Roderic Dreughardt, successor to the early imperial administration in the Protectorate, was central to the Compass’s understanding of how Veltraxis functioned under occupation, because he embodied the contradictions at the heart of the new regime. In public, he performed the necessary theater of triumph, commissioning statues of the Empress to stand over conquered plazas, funding purity festivals that celebrated the annihilation of Veltraxis’s arcane past, and delivering civic speeches extolling the virtues of obedience, righteousness, and imperial order. Yet numerous Compass operatives reported observing flickers of visible disdain in his expression during such events, as if even he could not stomach the reductive version of history he was obligated to repeat. 

Whether this indicated genuine ideological conflict or merely the fatigue of a man forced to maintain a narrative he did not believe was never definitively determined, but the Compass archived these observations because contradictions within rulers often revealed structural weaknesses within the state itself.

If the Protectorate was a realm of forced forgetting, then the Western Ashlands represented the place where memory had been shackled, starved, and left to fester. The Ashlands were built atop the ruins of the old heart of Veltraxis, where the Glass Citadel had once housed the Senate of Five and commanded the intellectual rhythm of the republic; now, that region lay buried beneath melted crystal, scorched stone, and toxic mana that hummed against the feet of those who walked the terrain. The compass observed with clinical interest how the inhabitants of the Ashlands constructed “Shard Hovels” from the splinters of their former city, creating shelters that glittered faintly under moonlight like broken mirrors reflecting a past no one was allowed to speak of. 

These inhabitants, composed of scholars whose hands had been maimed to enforce compliance, artificers whose craft had been outlawed, and descendants of Veltraxians confined through imperial decree, moved through their shattered republic with the quiet dignity of those who had no illusions left to lose.

The Empire treated the Ashlands as a colonial containment zone rather than territory, placing imperial overseers within fortified outposts who were charged not with governance but with surveillance and suppression. The Order’s Crusaders patrolled the perimeter of the Colony, ensuring that no arcane practices resurfaced, no forbidden texts circulated, and no unregistered rituals occurred, while also conducting periodic purges of suspected heretical materials that involved burning books, confiscating notes, and destroying any devices that resembled magical apparatus. The Compass noted that despite this oppressive oversight, the Ashlands possessed an internal resilience born of shared suffering, meaning that inhabitants often aided each other in ways that defied imperial regulations, such as secretly teaching children fragments of arcane theory or recounting censored histories under the guise of ghost stories. It was in these hidden pockets of the community that the Compass found the republic’s last remnants of curiosity, and it was curiosity, more than ideology, that served as Veltraxis’s final act of rebellion against the Empire that claimed to have saved it.

The Gilded Compass did not attempt open recruitment in Veltraxis because doing so would have resulted in immediate extermination of both recruiters and recruits, and instead relied on the slow cultivation of individual relationships built on practicality rather than doctrine. In the Protectorate, Compass agents offered minor illegal conveniences—rushed medical treatments that bypassed state paperwork, discreet courier work between separated families, and the quiet falsification of educational records that spared certain children from being drafted into imperial academies. In the Ashlands, the Compass traded in knowledge instead of favors, providing fragments of information about arcane stabilization techniques, smuggling in old texts believed to have been destroyed, and supplying tools that enabled injured artificers to resume modified versions of their craft without drawing imperial attention. These acts were not framed as charity but as transactional exchanges, because the Compass understood that the people of Veltraxis did not desire saviors, prophets, or liberators; they desired the ability to choose their own direction, even if that direction led only a few steps beyond the boundaries imposed upon them.

Conflict with Dreughardt authorities was inevitable, though not catastrophic, because the Compass had already learned from its earlier century within the Empire that invisibility was preferable to confrontation. Several agents were arrested and executed under charges of “arcane sedition,” a deliberately vague category that encompassed anything from possessing unsanctioned scholarly materials to encouraging conversations that questioned the legitimacy of imperial conquest. These losses were recorded without embellishment or sentimentality, because the Compass maintained the historian’s understanding that movements which operate across centuries cannot measure their progress in the survival of every individual. The important outcome was that the executions did not expose the wider structure of Compass operations, indicating that the faction’s methods of compartmentalization and false identities remained resilient even under Dreughardt’s notoriously efficient intelligence apparatus.

After nearly seven decades of quiet work, the Compass succeeded in establishing its base in Veltraxis, although the term “base” fails to capture the distributed architecture that was deliberately chosen to avoid detection. Unlike its fixed outposts in regions such as Frankleburg or Mont Marie, the Veltraxis base existed as an interconnected network of safe houses in the Protectorate, hidden archives in the Ashlands, merchant fronts in Protectorate trade districts, and covert medical stations staffed by Compass-trained healers posing as traveling clinicians. The faction found no success in centralizing operations because centralization was incompatible with the fragmented nature of Veltraxis itself, and instead embraced a model that reflected the republic’s divided condition, thereby reducing the risk that a single betrayal or imperial sweep could annihilate their presence entirely.

In time, Veltraxis became one of the most intellectually valuable territories within the Compass’s portfolio because its inhabitants possessed fluencies in theory, invention, and analysis that had survived imperial attempts at forced forgetting. Though the Compass never succeeded in restoring Veltraxis to its pre-conquest identity, it succeeded in preserving the republic’s capacity for thought, and it is from Veltraxis that many later breakthroughs in enchantment theory, vampiric mana integration, and arcane stabilization originated. The Ashlands produced scavengers who specialized in recovering lost technologies that the Empire did not understand well enough to confiscate, while the Protectorate produced disillusioned scholars who rediscovered curiosity behind closed doors. Through these contributions, the Gilded Compass transformed its Veltraxis base into something far more valuable than territory: it became a reservoir of intellect that had survived a purge meant to extinguish it.

In conclusion, Veltraxis did not become a sanctuary for the Gilded Compass, nor did it become a site of ideological triumph, liberation, or confrontation. It became instead a case study in adaptation, demonstrating that survival within an occupied republic required patience measured in decades, discretion measured in lifetimes, and ambitions measured not in territory but in preservation of possibility. The Compass recorded Veltraxis as a lesson rather than a victory, noting that even amidst ash, containment, and the weight of imperial control, the human mind continued to seek meaning, and that seeking was enough to justify the faction’s investment. Through Veltraxis, the Compass learned that rebellion can be loud, but endurance is quiet, and that sometimes the quietest forms of endurance leave the deepest mark on history. Thus closed the Compass’s two-century engagement with a republic that refused to die even after its city burned, its scholars were chained, and its glass citadel was reduced to shards beneath the boots of an empire convinced it had erased a culture forever.
