Four hundred and sixty-four years after the death of Amadeus, the Gilded Compass entered the Empire of Dreughardt. It did not do so by choice.

By this point in its history, the Compass had spread widely but unevenly. Its bases existed in regions defined by instability, balance, or distance from centralized power. Dreughardt represented the opposite: a unified empire, governed by fear, efficiency, and absolute authority. Where other realms fractured under the return of magic, Dreughardt moved first—and moved decisively. The Compass observed Dreughardt’s rise from afar. When magic returned, the Empire did not hesitate to interpret it as a threat rather than a gift. Empress Vanessa Dreughardt acted with the certainty of someone who believed history favored those who struck before they were challenged.

Veltraxis fell within days. Nexacra resisted longer and paid dearly. By the time news reached the Compass, the message was unmistakable: Dreughardt would not tolerate uncontrolled magic, independent movements, or ideologies it did not author. For the Gilded Compass—whose membership included vampires, enchanted humans, and practitioners of forbidden arts—this made Dreughardt lethal ground. And yet, it was precisely this danger that drew them in.

The Empire controlled vast resources, disciplined armies, and trade routes critical to the continent’s interior. To exist in the long term, the Compass needed access to imperial corridors—or at least the ability to move through them unseen. Avoidance was no longer sufficient. The decision to enter Dreughardt was framed not as expansion, but as containment. The Compass sought to understand the Empire from within, to establish footholds that could protect its members, and to ensure that Dreughardt did not become an unchecked force capable of erasing the faction entirely.

This was not an ideological mission. It was defensive realism. The Compass did not arrive as itself. Its members entered Dreughardt under forged affiliations: mercenary companies, healers contracted to border garrisons, scribes assigned to colonial administrations, and laborers absorbed into reconstruction efforts in conquered Veltraxis. Vampires were forbidden to enter openly. Those who did so anyway paid the price. Early attempts at concealment failed under imperial scrutiny; Dreughardt’s intelligence networks were thorough, their punishments exemplary.

Public executions followed, and the Compass adapted quickly. Vampires were restricted to peripheral zones—border provinces, underground districts, and territories still destabilized by war. Humans became the visible face of the faction. Enchanted individuals concealed their abilities entirely, passing as mundane citizens or suppressing their magic through alchemical dampeners. For the first time in its history, the Compass demanded complete ideological silence from its members.

No recruitment.  
No symbols.  
No doctrine.

Dreughardt was not governed by belief, but by enforcement. Magic was not merely illegal—it was treated as treason. Practitioners were mutilated, enslaved, or publicly displayed as warnings. Vampirism was classified as an abomination, its discovery punishable by immediate execution. The Compass lost many members in its early decades within the Empire. Some were betrayed by neighbors seeking favor. Others were exposed during routine inspections. A few chose to flee, abandoning years of progress rather than face inevitable death. The Compass did not retaliate - retaliation would have drawn attention. Instead, the faction did what it had always done best: it endured quietly. Despite its brutality, Dreughardt was not flawless.

Its obsession with obedience created blind spots. Officials valued compliance over competence. So long as taxes were paid and unrest suppressed, deeper investigations were rare. The Compass exploited this. Members embedded themselves in logistical roles—accountants, supply coordinators, medical overseers—positions that granted access without scrutiny. Over generations, these operatives learned the rhythms of imperial governance, the rivalries between nobles, and the inefficiencies hidden beneath Dreughardt’s iron discipline.

This intelligence was not weaponized immediately. It was archived. The Compass understood that Dreughardt was not a problem to be solved quickly. It was a problem to be outlasted. The death of Empress Vanessa marked a turning point; her fall during the Nexacran war shook the Empire’s certainty. Though her line endured, her presence—direct, uncompromising, and feared—could not be replicated. Successors ruled through inherited authority rather than earned terror.

For the Compass, this created opportunity. Imperial oversight loosened marginally. Resources were redirected toward vengeance against Nexacra. Internal power struggles distracted administrators from peripheral regions and the Compass moved carefully. Cells that had existed independently for decades began communicating again. Hidden caches were established. Vampires were relocated closer to population centers under deeper concealment. Still, no base was declared.

A medical network that quietly diverted supplies.  
A trade route that funneled goods without drawing notice.  
A record-keeping archive disguised as bureaucratic redundancy.

Only after many decades—nearly a century—did these systems converge into something recognizable as a base. Even then, it had no single location. The Dreughardt base existed as a distributed organism, impossible to destroy with a single strike. This was intentional. The Empire excelled at crushing visible threats. It struggled against things it could not see, name, or isolate.

The historian must note that the Compass paid a moral price for survival in Dreughardt. Members were forced to witness atrocities without intervening. Some enforced imperial laws themselves to maintain cover. Others rationalized inaction as a necessity. These decisions fractured the faction internally. Debates emerged—not publicly, but in private correspondence—over whether survival justified complicity. Whether the Compass had drifted too far from Amadeus’ original vision. No resolution was reached. The Compass did not exist to be pure - it existed to persist.

By the time the Compass acknowledged its Dreughardt base as secure, nearly two centuries had passed since its founding. It was the most dangerous base the faction maintained—and the most informative. From Dreughardt, the Compass learned how empires functioned when fear replaced faith, and how order could be weaponized more effectively than chaos.

These lessons would later shape the faction’s strategies during its return to Vardoran and its confrontations with Luminance. Dreughardt was never friendly to the Gilded Compass, but it never destroyed them either.

And in an empire built on erasure, that survival was, in itself, a quiet defiance.
