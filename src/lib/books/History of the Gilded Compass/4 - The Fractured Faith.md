One hundred and twenty-four years after the death of Amadeus, the Gilded Compass expanded beyond Frankleburg and Lumira and turned its attention toward Blightmoor.

The decision was neither idealistic nor impulsive. It was driven by necessity and observation. By this point, the Compass had endured generations of concealment beneath Luminance's shadow. While survival had been achieved, stagnation threatened the faction's long-term viability. Recruitment had slowed. Research suffered from restricted access to divergent magical traditions. Trade routes were predictable and therefore vulnerable.

Blightmoor presented a contradiction: a land defined by theological fracture, yet no longer governed by a single, absolute doctrine. Where Lumira enforced uniformity, Blightmoor endured tension. And where tension endured, space for deviation existed.

This assessment proved correct in principle. In practice, the cost was high.

Blightmoor was not a unified state. It was a wound held together by habit and exhaustion. Though reconciliation had occurred by the time the Compass arrived, its scars were visible in every aspect of daily life. Faith was cautious. Authority was shared uneasily. Memory carried more weight than law.

The Gilded Compass entered Blightmoor cautiously, initially through its western reaches. This was a deliberate choice. The western lands—once the domain of Nymeris' adherents—were accustomed to death as an accepted force rather than a corruption to be purged. Vampires, while not welcomed, were not immediately hunted. Enchanted humans were viewed with suspicion, but also curiosity.

Even so, the Compass was not perceived as neutral.

The faction's doctrine of cooperation between humans and vampires clashed with both historical extremes of Blightmoor's faith. To the east, remnants of Ignariel's solar orthodoxy viewed the Compass as blasphemous—an organization that embodied the very "imperfection" their god had once sought to erase. To the west, followers of Nymeris were wary of any group that spoke of balance yet carried the methods of conquest, trade leverage, and magical experimentation.

The first and most immediate problem was theological mistrust.

Blightmoor's people did not measure allegiance through banners or coin. They measured it through belief. The Compass refused to declare fealty to either divine legacy. This refusal, while intentional, placed the faction in a precarious position. To many, neutrality was indistinguishable from deceit.

Several early envoys were denied entry to settlements outright. Others were permitted to stay only under constant observation. In Mourning Holds, Compass members were required to submit to ritual questioning—questions not of loyalty, but of intent, dream, and memory. Vampires found these practices invasive. Humans found them unsettling. Cooperation was strained before it began.

The second problem was memory itself.

Blightmoor was a land that remembered. The Silence, the crusade, the collapse of magic—these were not distant events but living wounds. The Compass' mixed composition reminded many of past betrayals. Vampires evoked memories of necromantic excess. Enchanted humans recalled the Solar Forge and its devastation.

As a result, the faction's presence reopened old grievances.

In one instance, a Compass trade caravan was attacked not by soldiers or priests, but by civilians who believed the faction intended to reopen the Necropolis. In another, a Research Sect outpost was burned after rumors spread that its members were attempting to recreate pre-Silence magic. Both accusations were false. Neither was difficult to believe.

The third problem was magical instability.

Blightmoor's magic did not behave predictably. The land had endured collapse, deprivation, and uneven restoration. Residual effects lingered. Certain spells amplified unexpectedly. Others failed entirely. Vampires reported heightened sensitivity to dream phenomena, while humans experienced prolonged fatigue or hallucinations after exposure to specific sites.

Compass researchers documented these anomalies extensively. However, the act of documentation itself attracted suspicion. To the people of Blightmoor, excessive study of magic resembled the hubris that had once shattered their world.

The fourth problem was internal strain.

The Compass' long-standing policy of pragmatic unity was tested in Blightmoor more than anywhere else. Some vampire members felt constrained by the faction's caution, arguing that Blightmoor's cultural tolerance for death could be leveraged more aggressively. Conversely, many human members—particularly those unaccustomed to such open proximity to undeath—found the environment psychologically taxing.

Disagreements arose not over ideology, but over adaptation.

Leadership at the time resisted fragmentation. No faction-wide schism occurred. However, the strain reshaped the Compass' operational methods. Bases were smaller, more decentralized. Public-facing roles were rotated frequently to avoid association. Research was conducted discreetly, often under the guise of medical aid or agricultural assistance.

Despite these challenges, the Compass persisted.

What ultimately allowed the faction to establish a foothold was utility.

Blightmoor's reunified society was fragile. Infrastructure was incomplete. Knowledge had been lost. The Compass offered solutions without demanding conversion. Its healers treated plagues born of exhaustion rather than disease. Its craftsmen repaired bridges and irrigation systems damaged during the centuries of division. Its traders reopened limited routes between east and west, careful not to provoke old hostilities.

Gradually, perception shifted.

The Compass was not embraced, but it was tolerated. Its members were no longer automatically assumed to be agents of disruption. In some regions, they were regarded as necessary outsiders—useful precisely because they belonged fully to neither legacy.

Recruitment followed naturally.

Individuals disillusioned with dogma found appeal in the Compass' emphasis on function over faith. Those who had lived through both flame and silence recognized the value of balance enforced not by gods, but by discipline. Vampires, in particular, found Blightmoor less hostile than Lumira, though never entirely safe.

By the end of this period, the Gilded Compass had established multiple bases across Blightmoor. None were large. None were fortified ostentatiously. This was intentional. Visibility remained a liability.

The faction learned from Blightmoor as much as it contributed to it.

From Ignariel's excess, it learned the danger of unchecked conviction. From Nymeris' withdrawal, it learned the cost of abandonment. From the city's reconciliation, it learned that balance was not an ideal state, but an ongoing effort.

These lessons would shape the Compass' future expansions. Blightmoor did not make the Gilded Compass stronger through triumph.

It made it stronger through restraint. And restraint, history would show, was often the difference between survival and annihilation.
