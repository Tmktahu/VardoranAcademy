Thirteen years after the disappearance of Amadeus, the Gilded Compass ceased its wandering.

This decision was not born of confidence, but necessity. The years following the founder's loss had proven that constant movement, while useful for avoiding detection, eroded cohesion. Resources were wasted, knowledge fragmented, and discipline strained. The faction required a fixed point—somewhere to gather, to rebuild, and to endure.

That point was found in the southern reaches of Frankleburg, within territory now claimed by the Holy Queendom of Lumira.

The choice was calculated. Frankleburg, though unified in name, was fractured in spirit. The scars left by Lumira's conquest had not healed. Beneath banners of holy gold, resentment festered quietly. Old loyalties had not vanished; they had gone underground. For an organization accustomed to operating in secrecy, this unrest presented opportunity.

The Compass established its base far from major roads and cities, concealed by terrain and deliberate misinformation. Knowledge of its exact location was tightly restricted. Even within the faction, only those with operational necessity were informed. Outwardly, the Compass presented itself as a loose network of traders, scholars, and mercenaries, with no permanent holdings. For a time, this deception held.

Yet Lumira was not merely another conquered land. It was the seat of Luminance itself, and with that distinction came dangers unlike any the Compass had previously encountered. The first and most immediate problem was visibility.

Vampires could not move openly. Even those who exercised restraint were marked by fear and superstition. Humans bore the brunt of scrutiny as well. Enchantment, augmentation, and alchemical alteration—tools the Compass employed without hesitation—were increasingly associated with heresy. In Lumira, deviation from the Church's sanctioned form of magic was not debated; it was punished.

To conceal their nature, vampire members fed sparingly and discreetly. Many confined themselves to the base entirely, emerging only under cover of night or through intermediaries. Humans served as the faction's primary interface with surrounding settlements, though even this proved insufficient.

Lumira's population had been conditioned to report irregularity.

The Church encouraged vigilance. Neighbors informed on neighbors. Suspicion was framed as devotion. Any individual who traveled frequently, asked the wrong questions, or demonstrated unusual resilience was subject to scrutiny. Over time, this environment eroded the Compass' ability to operate unnoticed.

The second problem was holy surveillance.

Relics of light were common throughout Lumira—not merely as symbols, but as tools. Shrines, wards, and patrols were equipped with artifacts designed to detect corruption, undeath, or unapproved magic. These relics were imprecise, but they were numerous. While a single artifact might fail to identify a vampire who exercised restraint, repeated exposure increased risk.

The Compass learned quickly that remaining stationary was dangerous. Movement within Frankleburg became erratic by necessity. Supply routes shifted frequently. Trade contacts were rotated or abandoned without explanation. These precautions preserved secrecy, but at significant cost. Productivity declined. Internal tensions grew.

A third complication emerged gradually, and with less clarity.

Holy power flowed through Lumira in unnatural abundance. This concentration of radiance had consequences. Reports from Compass researchers noted disturbances—sensations of pressure, unease, or awareness—felt most strongly by vampire members. These sensations intensified near the capital and along pilgrimage routes.

The prevailing theory within the Research Sect was that something had been drawn to Lumira by this concentration of power. Whether summoned intentionally or awakened incidentally remained unknown. Local rumors spoke of a leviathan, bound or bargained with by the Church. The Compass could not confirm these accounts, but circumstantial evidence suggested heightened detection capabilities within Lumira's borders.

Several near-exposures were recorded.

In one instance, a vampire courier was intercepted not by paladins, but by civilians who claimed to have "felt wrongness" in his presence. In another, a hidden storage site was discovered despite no known compromise of its location. These incidents were officially attributed to coincidence, but the pattern was troubling.

The fourth problem was ideological hostility.

Frankleburg's populace did not view the Compass as liberators. To many, the presence of vampires—regardless of behavior—represented a continuation of suffering rather than resistance. While resentment toward Lumira ran deep, fear of undeath ran deeper. The Compass found itself unable to fully integrate with local dissenters. Trust was conditional, fragile, and easily broken.

Even among those opposed to Luminance, cooperation with vampires was seen as a moral compromise too far. This limited the faction's ability to recruit openly or establish reliable alliances.

The final and most dangerous issue was infiltration.

Luminance did not need to know where the Compass was to undermine it. Informants were planted among traders, pilgrims, and displaced citizens. Some acted out of faith. Others were coerced. A few sought reward. Over time, fragments of information accumulated. A pattern formed.

The Compass was forced to confront an uncomfortable truth: hiding within Lumira was possible, but never safe.

Despite these challenges, the faction endured.

Its base remained undiscovered in any official capacity. No crusade was launched. No declaration was made. The Compass adapted—limiting activity, refining concealment, and enduring isolation. It learned to exist beneath the crown of light without drawing its gaze.

This period shaped the faction profoundly.

Caution became doctrine. Visibility was treated as a liability. Expansion was delayed in favor of consolidation. Above all, the Compass learned that proximity to Luminance was both a shield and a threat: shielded by Frankleburg's internal unrest, threatened by Lumira's relentless vigilance. Thirteen years after Amadeus' death, the Compass had not reclaimed momentum.

But it survived. In Lumira's shadow, survival was no small achievement. And survival, as history would demonstrate, was often enough.
