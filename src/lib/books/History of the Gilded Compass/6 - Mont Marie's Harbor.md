Two hundred and twenty-nine years after the death of Amadeus, the Gilded Compass made a decision that would redefine its understanding of security. Until this point, the faction had expanded along land routes, refugee paths, and ideological fault lines. Every base it established existed within reach of greater powers—empires, churches, leviathans, or gods. Survival depended on secrecy, compromise, and endurance.

Mont Marie offered something different.It offered distance. Mont Marie was not chosen for its beliefs, nor for sympathy toward the Compass’ ideals. It was chosen because Luminance could not reach it easily. The island’s resistance during the Holy Conquest had demonstrated a fundamental truth: faith did not win wars at sea. Fleets did. While Lumira’s paladins marched across Frankleburg under banners of light, Mont Marie remained untouched, its harbors open, its trade uninterrupted. For the Gilded Compass, whose greatest enemy relied on centralized authority and overland dominance, this mattered more than ideology.

Initial contact was not made through diplomats or missionaries, but through trade intermediaries—independent merchants already doing business with Compass-affiliated settlements. Goods moved first. Names followed later. This was deliberate.Mont Marie distrusted causes. Its independence had been earned through pragmatism, not martyrdom. The Compass learned quickly that presenting itself as a faction would invite scrutiny, while presenting itself as a network invited opportunity.

Unlike previous expansions, the Compass did not attempt to establish a base openly. Instead, it fragmented its presence. Warehouses were rented under separate names. Dockworkers were hired without knowledge of shared affiliation. Researchers entered as scholars, healers as physicians, security operatives as guards for merchant vessels. Vampires posed the greatest challenge.

Mont Marie’s ports never slept. Sunlight reflected endlessly off water and stone, leaving little natural cover. Feeding was tightly regulated within the city, and unexplained disappearances drew swift investigation. The Compass adapted, Vampires were restricted to underground facilities, night-only operations, or long-term residence aboard ships where movement and feeding could be controlled. Human intermediaries handled daytime affairs. Over time, the arrangement became routine rather than exceptional.

This division of labor, refined here, would later become standard practice across the faction. What truly allowed the Compass to root itself in Mont Marie was naval integration. The island respected skill above allegiance. Those who contributed to its maritime dominance were protected, regardless of origin. The Compass invested heavily in this principle. Shipwrights from Velgrath brought cold-resistant hull designs. Engineers from Blightmoor contributed preservation techniques and alchemical treatments that extended voyages. Navigators trained under Compass funding produced maps that improved Mont Marie’s control of surrounding waters.

In exchange, the Compass gained access. Not immunity, but invisibility. So long as its members were useful, their presence was tolerated. So long as their ships strengthened Mont Marie’s fleets, their origins were not questioned. This relationship was not built on trust. It was built on mutual benefit. For the first time since its founding, the Gilded Compass experienced something resembling safety. Mont Marie’s isolation meant that raids were rare, surveillance was manageable, and external interference was limited. Luminance could not enforce doctrine across the sea without provoking naval war, something it had long avoided.

This stability had consequences. Leadership became less reactive. Research progressed without constant interruption. Recruitment slowed but improved in quality. Members lived longer. The faction began to change. Critics within the Compass later argued that Mont Marie made the faction complacent. That safety dulled urgency. That distance from suffering weakened resolve. The historical record suggests a more nuanced outcome. Mont Marie did not soften the Compass. It restructured it.

After nearly a decade of dispersed operation, the Compass formalized its presence. The base was not constructed as a fortress. It was built as infrastructure. Subterranean storage chambers beneath a legitimate trade district. A hidden harbor accessible only through mapped tidal channels. Living quarters integrated into existing city blocks rather than isolated compounds. The base did not announce itself because it did not need to. By the time Mont Marie’s authorities became aware of its scale, dismantling it would have disrupted trade, naval readiness, and local employment. The Compass had embedded itself too deeply to remove cleanly.

This was intentional. Despite its success, the Compass did not find ideological harmony in Mont Marie. The island valued independence fiercely. Any suggestion of allegiance beyond the sea was met with resistance. While Mont Marie tolerated vampires pragmatically, it did not embrace them culturally. Prejudices persisted, particularly among older naval families. The Compass responded by doing what it did best: withholding belief. Its doctrines were not preached openly. Recruitment was selective. Members were instructed not to proselytize unless asked. The Compass existed in Mont Marie not as a movement, but as a presence.

This restraint preserved the base. Historians often question why Mont Marie succeeded where Blightmoor, Velgrath, and others faltered. The answer is not singular - Mont Marie was not spiritually aligned with the Compass, but it was structurally compatible. It rewarded contribution, tolerated difference, and prioritized survival over purity. More importantly, it was not landlocked. Water introduced uncertainty for enemies and opportunity for those who understood it. The Compass learned, here, that control of movement mattered more than control of territory. Mont Marie did not shelter the Compass out of kindness. It did so because the Compass made itself indispensable. The Mont Marie base became a model.

From it, the Compass refined long-distance coordination, maritime intelligence, and decentralized leadership. The lessons learned there would later shape how the faction operated during its return to Vardoran and its confrontations with Luminance. Yet even as Mont Marie became a cornerstone of Compass security, it remained a reminder of limitation. The faction had not defeated its enemies. It had merely placed water between itself and them. For a time, that was enough. And for the first time since Amadeus’ death, the Gilded Compass was not merely surviving - it was enduring.
