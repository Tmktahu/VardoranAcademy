One hundred and fifty-six years after the death of Amadeus, the Gilded Compass reached the limits of continental certainty. By this point, the faction was no longer obscure. Its name carried weight among traders, refugees, and dissidents across several regions. Its methods were studied by its enemies. Its movements were anticipated. Expansion was no longer a matter of opportunity, but of risk management.

Two destinations remained beyond its effective reach: Velgrath, isolated by sea and climate, and the Deadlands, isolated by death itself. The Compass did not approach them simultaneously by chance. It did so because delay would have meant surrendering both regions to forces already hostile to its existence. Velgrath could not be reached by stealth. The northern seas were unforgiving, and travel across them required weeks of exposure to freezing spray, unstable currents, and unpredictable storms. Ships that vanished were not remarked upon. This reality imposed an immediate limitation on the Gilded Compass: vampires could not make the crossing.

Extended exposure to sunlight reflected off ice and water weakened them severely, and the cold slowed regenerative abilities to the point of failure. Magical shielding was unreliable in open waters, and any vessel large enough to accommodate protected transport would attract attention.

As a result, the Compass made an unprecedented decision: only human envoys were sent. This was not without consequence.

The faction’s philosophy was founded on cooperation between humans and vampires, yet here it was forced to act in contradiction to its own principles. Those chosen for the Velgrath expeditions were volunteers, but the unspoken truth remained: they were expendable in ways their vampire counterparts were not.

The journey itself claimed lives. Several ships never reached Velgrath’s shores. Others arrived damaged, with crews suffering frostbite, starvation, or madness brought on by prolonged isolation. Those who survived were not greeted with suspicion, but with ritual mourning for those lost at sea—a Velgrathian custom that unsettled many Compass envoys accustomed to secrecy rather than ceremony.

Velgrath’s tribes accepted refugees readily, but they did not accept causes. The Gilded Compass was not perceived as an organization at first. It was perceived as a collection of displaced humans seeking shelter. This misunderstanding initially worked in the faction’s favor. Integration occurred organically. Skills were exchanged. Trust was built slowly. Problems emerged only when intent became clear. Velgrath’s culture valued contribution over ideology. The Compass’ emphasis on belief, structure, and long-term strategy conflicted with the tribes’ immediate survival focus. Leadership councils viewed the idea of a transregional faction as unnecessary at best, dangerous at worst. The awakening of the Frost Leviathan compounded these tensions.

As the land grew harsher, Velgrath became inward-facing. Outsiders—regardless of intent—were increasingly seen as potential burdens. When Compass envoys proposed coordinated defenses, shared intelligence networks, and long-term trade routes, resistance grew. The final point of contention was the question of vampires.

Though none had crossed the sea, their existence was known. Tales from refugees painted them inconsistently: protectors in some lands, tyrants in others. Velgrathians, shaped by oral tradition and practical necessity, asked a single question: Why bring a weakness into a land that already seeks to kill us? The Compass had no satisfactory answer.

Ultimately, Velgrath did not formally join the Gilded Compass. Instead, a compromise was reached. Independent cooperation agreements were established between individual villages and Compass trade envoys. Knowledge, medicine, and metalwork were exchanged. No banners were raised. No oaths sworn.Velgrath remained aligned, but not claimed. This outcome was considered a success, though it exposed a critical limitation: the Compass’ ideals were not universally desirable, even among those who benefited from them. If Velgrath tested the Compass’ principles, the Deadlands tested its survivability. Unlike Velgrath, the Deadlands could not be approached openly. No ship sailed its shores. No road crossed its heart. The land itself rejected permanence.

Initial expeditions consisted of mixed teams—humans, vampires, researchers, and security operatives. This proved to be a mistake. Necromantic saturation affected vampires unpredictably. Some reported heightened strength followed by sudden, catastrophic degradation. Others experienced involuntary bloodlust triggered not by hunger, but by proximity to undeath. These failures were neither consistent nor controllable.

The Compass withdrew vampires from all deep Deadlands operations within the first decade. Human operatives fared no better. The Lich King’s erratic movements rendered maps obsolete within months. Safe paths became death traps overnight. Entire teams vanished without trace. Others returned psychologically altered, reporting lost time, auditory hallucinations, or compulsions to return to the wastes.

The Necrotic Leviathan presented a different problem. Unlike the Lich King, it did not move randomly. It followed patterns of necrotic concentration, which meant Compass activity attracted it. Research camps were destroyed not because they were discovered, but because their presence altered the magical ecology of the area.

Attempts at negotiation failed entirely. The Cult of the Necrotic Leviathan interpreted the Compass as competition. Its members were seized, sacrificed, or incorporated into Processions when possible. Those who resisted were killed publicly to demonstrate devotion.

In one documented instance, a Compass healer was captured and forced to keep sacrificial victims alive long enough for the Lich King to consume them. The healer survived only because the Procession was annihilated shortly afterward by an undead surge. The psychological damage rendered them unfit for further service. The Stalwart border villages proved marginally more receptive. Their needs aligned temporarily with the Compass’: survival, defense, and information. However, cooperation was transactional and fragile. When Compass patrols failed to prevent a Procession raid, alliances dissolved immediately. Trust in the Deadlands was binary and fleeting.

The greatest obstacle was ideological incompatibility. The Gilded Compass believed in regulation, control, and balance. The Deadlands existed in perpetual imbalance. Its inhabitants did not seek harmony; they sought endurance. Many believed the Lich King and the Leviathan were inevitable, immutable forces. To challenge them was arrogance. The Compass could not argue otherwise without undermining its own credibility. After decades of losses, the faction altered its objectives. Rather than expansion, it pursued containment.

Small observation posts were established and abandoned regularly. Intelligence was gathered through Scavengers rather than direct presence. Trade focused on relic acquisition rather than influence. The Deadlands would not be converted, stabilized, or unified. They would be watched. This decision marked a turning point in the Compass’ history. For the first time, the faction formally acknowledged that some regions could not be integrated without unacceptable cost.

The twin failures of Velgrath and the Deadlands reshaped the Gilded Compass permanently. Human-only operations created internal divisions that never fully healed. Vampires questioned their role in a faction increasingly shaped by human limitation. Researchers grew more cautious, security forces more pragmatic.

Yet the Compass endured. It learned that expansion was not conquest. That belief could not always be exported. That some lands required respect, others restraint, and a few only distance.

Amadeus had believed the Compass could correct the world’s course. His successors learned instead to navigate it. And in that distinction lay the faction’s continued survival.
