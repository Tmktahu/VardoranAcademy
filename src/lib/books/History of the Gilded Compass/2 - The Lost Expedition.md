Fifteen years after the founding of the Gilded Compass, its future narrowed to a single course.

By this point, the faction had survived its infancy. Its ideology had stabilized, its membership had grown modestly, and its internal divisions—Research, Trade, and Security—were functional, if still informal. Yet one matter remained unresolved: the Church of Luminance, and at its head, Solarus.

Amadeus had never concealed his belief that Luminance would not tolerate the Compass indefinitely. In his assessment, coexistence was not a disagreement to be debated but a threat to the Church's authority. So long as Solarus lived and the Church remained unified, the Compass would be hunted—if not openly, then quietly and persistently.

For fifteen years, Amadeus delayed direct confrontation. He consolidated resources, observed Luminance's movements, and tested the limits of its reach. When he finally chose to act, it was not impulsive. Records suggest that his decision followed months of preparation and internal debate. The destination was clear: Vardoran, the heartland of Luminance's power.

The party that accompanied Amadeus was small by design. This was not an invasion force, but a surgical strike—either to eliminate Solarus directly or to cripple the Church's leadership sufficiently to fracture its influence.

Eight warriors were selected.
- Lady Kaela, noted for her tactical acuity and prior experience commanding mixed-species units.
- Sir Maelrik, a veteran of multiple Luminance campaigns before defecting, whose familiarity with their combat doctrine was considered invaluable.
- Sir Berin, whose strength and endurance were widely remarked upon in early Compass records.
- Lady Seren, skilled in reconnaissance and silent movement.
- Sir Edran, a disciplined fighter known for rigid adherence to orders.
- Lady Nimara, whose combat style favored precision over brute force.
- Sir Tavik, the youngest of the group, was included despite objections due to his adaptability and loyalty.

Accompanying them was Dontrix, a healer and researcher whose presence distinguished the mission from a purely martial endeavor. Dontrix's role was twofold: to ensure the group's survival and to document arcane or magical phenomena encountered along the way. His inclusion suggests that Amadeus anticipated more than conventional battle.

The group departed quietly. No formal announcements were made, and no ceremonies marked their leaving. This absence of spectacle was intentional. Amadeus believed that secrecy was their greatest protection. It was also their last.

The route into Vardoran was known to be dangerous even before the events that would later define the region. Hostile patrols, unstable magic, and creatures displaced by the Church's purges made the journey treacherous. Nevertheless, the group was well-equipped and experienced. Under ordinary circumstances, their chances of reaching their destination were considered acceptable. They did not return.

No witnesses reported their arrival in Vardoran. No evidence of battle was discovered along known routes. No artifacts, remains, or messages were recovered. For a time, the Compass assumed delay. Then misfortune. Then ambush. Years passed. Theories multiplied.

Some believed the group had been intercepted by Luminance forces and executed in secrecy, their deaths concealed to deny the Compass martyrs. Others speculated that internal betrayal had doomed them, though no credible evidence ever supported this claim. More speculative accounts suggested that the party encountered something older and more dangerous than Luminance—an anomaly of magic, a relic, or a force that did not distinguish between faith and heresy.

Dontrix's disappearance fueled further uncertainty. As both healer and researcher, his loss deprived the Compass not only of a skilled practitioner but of a potential chronicler who might have recorded what transpired. The absence of his notes, reagents, or instruments suggests that whatever befell the group was sudden, total, or deliberately obscured.

The impact on the Gilded Compass was immediate and destabilizing.

Amadeus had never formally named a successor. Authority fractured among senior members, none of whom possessed his combination of conviction and restraint. Some advocated for immediate retaliation. Others urged withdrawal and concealment. A minority argued that Amadeus' fate proved the futility of confronting Luminance directly. None of these positions prevailed entirely. In the end, the Compass chose survival.

Leadership became provisional and distributed. Decisions were made collectively, often slowly, and with an increased emphasis on risk avoidance. The faction retreated from overt operations and abandoned any immediate plans to challenge Luminance head-on. This shift was not ideological surrender but strategic recalibration.

Notably, the principles established by Amadeus did not erode in his absence. Humans and vampires continued to operate side by side. Discipline was maintained. Arrogance—particularly among newly turned vampires—was still addressed harshly. In this sense, the founder's influence persisted, even as his presence was gone.

As for Solarus, no public acknowledgment of the expedition was ever made by the Church of Luminance. Whether he was aware of the attempt on his life remains unknown. If he was, he chose silence. This silence, too, became a source of unease.

Over time, Amadeus' fate transitioned from immediate concern to historical ambiguity. He was recorded as deceased, though the manner of his death was never specified. The warriors who accompanied him were honored in name only. No shrines were erected. No remains interred. Their legacy became one of absence rather than closure.

This lack of resolution shaped the Compass in subtle but lasting ways.

Caution became a habit. Redundancy became doctrine. No future leader would wield unchecked authority, and no mission would ever again place the faction's survival on a single outcome. The Compass learned, through loss, that direction must outlast individuals.

What truly occurred in Vardoran remains unresolved. Perhaps it always will. The historian's duty is not to speculate, but to record what is known.

What is known is this: Amadeus set out to confront Luminance and Solarus. He did not return. Neither did those who followed him. The world continued, altered but unbroken. And the Gilded Compass endured—not because its founder survived, but because his ideas did.

The consequences of that disappearance would echo for centuries.
