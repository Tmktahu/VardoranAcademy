## Mental Fragments
When life ceases, awareness does not vanish instantly. Echoes linger as temporary impressions that dissipate over time. These are not souls, which imply something transcendent and eternal, but finite mental echoes.

Duration varies unpredictably. Strong-willed individuals leave fragments that persist longer. Violent or emotionally charged deaths create stronger echoes. Natural death from old age produces weaker fragments that fade quickly. Some fragments dissipate within hours, while others linger for weeks or even years.

Fragments possess no agency or awareness in the conventional sense. When questioned, they respond with information available at the moment of death. They cannot observe current events. They cannot learn. They simply exist until they fade.

Mordecai describes fragments with characteristic enthusiasm: "Imagine sound echoing in a canyon! The echo isn't the original sound, just a reflection that diminishes with each repetition. Delightful acoustic phenomenon! Mental fragments work exactly the same way. I measured this with Subject Ninety-Two, strong-willed individual, very promising specimen. The fragment persisted for eighteen days before fading completely, and I watched it degrade gradually over that entire period. Nothing mystical about it, just pure dissipation physics. Absolutely fascinating process!"
## Contest of Wills
Fragments retain residual willpower, a passive impression of the strength their mind once possessed. Not active resistance, but static resistance that must be overcome through direct confrontation. The practitioner projects their will against this residual resistance. Stronger imposition dominates static resistance.

Living minds present an entirely different challenge. Active minds resist with full willpower and agency. The target actively opposes, adapts, and maintains mental strength through continuous adaptation. The dynamic, shifting nature of active minds makes it impossible to lock down with any finite willpower. No mortal possesses infinite willpower, making sustained control of living minds impossible.

Mordecai tested the difference extensively: "Fragments versus living minds? Completely different resistance profiles! Subject Fifty-Eight's fragment degraded steadily with predictable decline, but then Subject Fifty-Nine, a living target, actually got stronger as they figured out what I was doing and adapted their mental defenses in real-time. I even tried sedation on Subject Sixty-Three and they still adapted within moments. The living mind adapts and fights back while the fragment just fades away. I tested dozens of subjects and every single living mind adapts. Absolutely remarkable difference!"
## The Impossibility of Binding Living Minds
Theoretical discussions of imposing directives onto living minds persist in unholy magic literature, but practical application proves impossible for mortal practitioners.

A practitioner might momentarily disrupt a living mind's focus or create brief hesitation through overwhelming will, but sustained control cannot be achieved. The target's mind reasserts itself immediately.

Mordecai tested forty-three subjects and every single one failed within seconds: "Subject Seventy-One was the weakest-willed individual I could find and they still reasserted autonomy immediately, while Subject Seventy-Two was heavily sedated and broke free just as quickly. I tried everything including meditation, charged emeralds, and working in my maximally saturated workshop, but nothing worked. The living mind adapts faster than any finite willpower can suppress, and when I calculated the theoretical willpower requirement it came out to infinite, literally infinite! No mortal achieves this, so the attempt itself is futile. Fascinating from a theoretical perspective but completely impractical for application."

Some practitioners claim ritual applications with multiple contributors might achieve binding. This assumes combined finite willpower becomes infinite. It does not, as demonstrated by ritual attempts on living targets.
## Speaking with the Dead
Extracting information from fragments requires dominating the residual echo and shaping interrogation directives.

The practitioner locates the fragment through will-saturation sensitivity. Fragments cluster in death locations and saturated environments. Once located, the practitioner imposes will onto the fragment, forcing it to manifest perceptibly.

Once manifested, interrogation can begin. The practitioner shapes specific queries. The fragment responds with information available at death. Broad questions yield unreliable results. Precise queries extract precise information. "What killed you?" functions better than "What happened?"

Forcing manifestation accelerates fragment dissipation. Extended interrogations consume the echo entirely. Practitioners must extract information efficiently before the fragment fades.

Mordecai quantified fragment exhaustion obsessively: "I interrogated Subject Eighty-Three for twelve minutes and coherence collapsed at nine minutes with complete dissipation at fourteen. Then Subjects Eighty-Four through Ninety-One confirmed the identical pattern, every single one of them! Nine minutes consistently marks the degradation point, so I optimized all subsequent interrogations for an eight-minute maximum to extract everything before the collapse. Now my students waste far fewer fragments through inefficient questioning. Beautiful optimization!"
## Phantom Summoning
For phantom summoning mechanics and practical constraints, see Volume 2: Combat Applications.

Beyond combat applications, sustained phantom manifestation enables advanced interrogation. Unlike brief questioning of manifested fragments, sustained presence allows extended information extraction over multiple sessions. The visible phantom also serves psychological warfare purposes through intimidation and strategic deployment of the deceased's presence.
## Ritual Applications
Multi-practitioner rituals amplify individual capability but introduce coordination complexity. Multiple practitioners contributing will-saturation to a single working exceeds individual capacity. Binding powerful fragments or manifesting multiple phantoms simultaneously becomes possible through combined force.

Each practitioner must shape an identical directive. Misaligned intent creates interference, so ritual effectiveness depends on synchronized will imposition.

Mordecai participated in collaborative fragment binding ritual: "Eight practitioners working together! We targeted Subject One-Hundred-Twenty-Seven's fragment, which had exceptionally strong residual willpower that would have taken a single practitioner hours to dominate, but with eight synchronized impositions we managed it in under a minute. The fragment had no chance against the combined force and it was a magnificent demonstration! Then we got excited and immediately attempted a similar ritual on a living target, Subject One-Hundred-Twenty-Eight, which was a complete failure. The living consciousness adapted to recognize eight separate impositions and distributed resistance accordingly, and two of our practitioners even got nosebleeds from the backlash. Finite combined willpower simply cannot overcome infinite adaptability, so rituals work beautifully on fragments but are completely useless on living minds."
## Ethical Boundaries
Understanding mechanics does not justify deployment. Some applications cause irreparable harm.

Speaking with dead and skeleton animation manipulate what consciousness has already abandoned. These represent acceptable applications within an ethical framework.

Working against living minds, even unsuccessfully, violates autonomy and inflicts damage.

Mordecai discovered ethical constraints through experimentation: "Efficiency doesn't require cruelty! I learned this with Subjects Seventy-Three through Eighty-Two when I tested various torture applications and got terrible results. The screaming disrupted my concentration, subjects died before I could get useful data, and workshop morale absolutely plummeted. Then I switched methods entirely. Skeletons provide overwhelming force without harming any living minds, and fragment interrogation extracts information without any torture needed. My later subjects gave me far better data quality with zero torture, much clearer results! Also there was considerably less screaming, which meant my workshop environment improved dramatically. Engineering optimization and moral framework achieved simultaneously with magnificent results!"
