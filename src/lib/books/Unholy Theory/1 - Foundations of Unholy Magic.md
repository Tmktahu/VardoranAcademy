## What Unholy Magic Is
Unholy magic is magic saturated with will. Take neutral magical energy and infuse it with will, and you create unholy magic. The saturation itself defines the school, not any particular effect or directive.

Mordecai describes it in mechanical terms: "Raw magic is like unworked iron! Beautiful in potential but useless until you forge it into something. Will saturation is the forging process. Hammer your intent into it, shape it, make it yours! What you build with it afterward... that's just application. The saturation is where the real work happens."

After extensive observation of Mordecai's work, the mechanism is clear. Practitioners channel magical energy and simultaneously impose their will into it. The magic becomes a carrier medium for will itself. This charged energy can then be shaped, stored, or released according to need.
## Theory of Origin
The name "unholy" likely comes from the Church of Luminance, though this remains unconfirmed.

According to Church doctrine, holy magic functions through deity-saturated energy. Worshippers claim Luminance imposes divine will onto magical energy and gifts it to the faithful who submit to divine directive. If accurate, this would represent will-saturation with divine rather than mortal will.

Fragmentary historical records suggest an origin story. Early unholy practitioners may have been Luminance worshippers who attempted to control their gifted magic independently. The Church would have labeled them heretics and expelled them. Those individuals then adapted, collecting ambient magical energy and imposing their own will onto it, perhaps the only method they understood from religious practice.

Whether this narrative represents actual events or later propaganda remains unclear. What is demonstrable through observation is that both holy and unholy magic appear to operate through will-saturation. The difference lies in the claimed source: deity versus mortal. Whether deities actually saturate magic or worshippers simply believe they do remains theological speculation.

Mordecai finds the theory delightful: "Oh, I love this story! They called it unholy because mortals dared to do what their god supposedly did. Control through will! The sheer audacity. Church propaganda became the school's name, and now here we are, centuries later, doing exactly what terrified them. Efficient branding and excellent irony. If it's false, well, someone invented a compelling story. Either way, we win."
## Emerald Affinity
Emeralds possess natural affinity for unholy magic. The mechanism appears similar to ruby's affinity for blood magic, though the applications differ.

Combat-cut emeralds amplify will during active channeling. When a practitioner projects will through a properly prepared emerald, the imposed intent strengthens. Effects manifest more powerfully, last longer, and affect more targets.

More significantly, emeralds store will-infused magic without requiring specific directives. A practitioner can charge an emerald with their will, and another person can later shape that stored energy into whatever intent they need at the moment of use. The flexibility proves tactically valuable.

Mordecai likens it to stored mechanical tension: "I built this clockwork spider once. Beautiful thing. Spring-loaded legs. Wind it up, it holds all that tension, ready to deploy however you program the release mechanism. Emeralds work the same way! Charge one with will, and whoever picks it up can use it for whatever they need. I gave Subject Twenty-Three a charged emerald with no directive. Fascinating results. They created a phantom with stored energy I had saturated weeks prior. The flexibility is magnificent."
## Universal Accessibility
Any being with will can learn unholy magic. Where holy magic purportedly requires divine gift and submission, unholy magic operates through self-generated will and remains accessible to all.

Strength of will determines capability. A human with sufficient training commands unholy magic as effectively as a vampire with equivalent training. Neither possesses inherent advantage.

Mordecai notes the practical implications: "In my workshop, I've trained mortals and immortals alike. The mortals often grasp it faster! No centuries of bad habits. Subject Eight... lovely woman, entirely mortal, animated her first skeleton in three days. Subject Nine was a two-hundred-year-old vampire who kept trying to channel it like blood magic. Took him two weeks! Fresh minds, fresh approaches. The mortals surprise me more often."

This accessibility creates different cultural associations than holy or blood magic. Anyone studying death, will, or the boundary between can engage with it academically or practically.
## Environmental Saturation
Will-saturated magic accumulates naturally in locations where intent lingers or intense will projection has occurred.

Graveyards accumulate will-saturated magic from lingering fragments of intent. When life ceases, echoes of will remain for a time before dissipating. Battlefields accumulate charge from the intense will to survive or kill projected during conflict. Execution sites, torture chambers, anywhere minds experienced extreme duress all create saturation through that projection.

Practitioners working repeatedly in specific locations create saturation through their practice. Each casting leaves trace charge. Accumulated over time, this creates environments rich with will-infused magic that can be drawn upon.

Mordecai maintains his workshop saturated intentionally. "Why generate all the saturation fresh each time when I can build up reserves? The workshop remembers my work! Every animation, every experiment, every successful imprint leaves traces. It's like marinating meat. The longer you leave it, the better it gets. My walls practically hum with accumulated will now. New students walk in and feel it immediately. Some find it unsettling. I find it efficient."
## Theoretical Boundaries
Unholy magic excels at imposing intent on matter but faces clear limitations.

The practice requires will as fuel. A practitioner must either channel magic and infuse it with their will, draw from charged emeralds, or work in saturated environments. Without will to impose, there is no unholy magic.

Living minds resist imposed intent naturally. Binding living targets requires active contest of wills (the struggle for dominance between practitioner will and target resistance, covered fully in Volume 3). Dead matter offers no such resistance but operates only as long as the imprinted intent maintains coherence. Neither situation provides unlimited control.

Unholy magic imposes behavioral directives. That is the scope. It cannot create physical structures like frost barriers. It cannot manipulate life force like blood magic. It cannot generate chaos fire or craft illusions.

Mordecai puts it simply: "I can make a skeleton walk, fight, even dance if I'm feeling whimsical. Had Subject Thirty-Seven perform a waltz once. Remarkable coordination for something without muscles! But I cannot make it think independently. Cannot make it feel pain or fear or ambition. Cannot make it grow stronger through experience. It's an automated construct, not a living thing. Beautiful, efficient, dead. Know the difference or you'll waste everyone's time trying to make corpses into people."
