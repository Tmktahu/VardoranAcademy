## Combat Philosophy
Unholy magic approaches combat through numerical superiority and sacrifice mechanics. Where blood magic sustains through parasitic extraction and frost magic defends through energy removal, unholy magic dominates through mass deployment and acceptable losses.

Mordecai articulates the tactical framework: "Living soldiers require food, rest, training, morale. Such tedious maintenance! Animated constructs require only will and corpses. Both consumable resources, both abundant. Deploy ten skeletons and lose eight in glorious expenditure to win the engagement. The calculus is beautiful. Superior numbers through acceptable attrition. I ran the numbers seventeen times. The math doesn't lie."

The practitioner remains removed from direct combat. Imprinted constructs engage while the animator maintains distance, directing intent and replacing losses. The enemy faces multiple targets while the practitioner presents minimal vulnerability.
## Skeleton Animation
Combat skeleton creation requires three components: corpse, will-saturated magic, and shaped directive.

The corpse provides physical structure. Any humanoid corpse functions, though skeletal remains offer the most reliable results. Flesh complicates animation through decomposition variables. Bone offers consistent structural integrity. Mordecai notes: "Flesh is a liability! Rot introduces failure points, unpredictable degradation, unpleasant smells that distract students. Strip to skeleton or wait for nature to do it. I've tested both methods extensively. Subject Forty-One was a fresh corpse. Subject Forty-Two was a year-old skeleton. Forty-Two outperformed in every metric. Patience yields superior constructs. Also fewer complaints about the smell."

Will saturation provides animating force. Outside combat, practitioners draw from charged emeralds or saturated environments. Combat eliminates these options, requiring practitioners to channel magic and infuse it with their own will. Tactical constraint: animate constructs before combat begins, or rely on personal reserves mid-fight.

The directive shapes behavior. Directive complexity determines mental strain on the practitioner. Simple combat commands require minimal focus and brief recovery. Complex directives demand greater concentration and extended recovery periods before the practitioner can animate again. Most practitioners favor simple directives for rapid successive animations.

Imprinting functions like stamping ink onto parchment. The practitioner shapes intent, imposes it onto the corpse, and the directive animates without further input. The magical "ink" depletes gradually based on complexity.
## Phantom Combat Summoning
Practitioners can summon mental fragments directly for combat rather than animating corpses. This proves more demanding mentally but eliminates corpse dependency.

The process requires locating a fragment, dominating it through contest of wills, and forcing manifestation. The fragment appears as a hazy, translucent form, a phantom impression of its former appearance. Not a solid body. A semi-corporeal presence.

Mordecai describes the mental strain: "Fragment summoning is a constant wrestling match! Skeleton gets imprinted, runs itself, I move to next task. Phantom? I'm fighting its residual will the entire time. Even dominated fragments resist manifestation. Mental exhaustion accumulates rapidly. Subject Ninety-Seven's phantom lasted eight minutes before I had to release it. I had a headache for hours afterward. Fascinating but brutal on the practitioner."

The sustained effort limits directive complexity to basic commands. Simple melee attacks prove manageable. Anything more sophisticated exhausts the practitioner rapidly.

Phantoms lack physical form but interact with material targets through imposed will. The fragment's forced presence creates tangible impact. Enemies feel strikes. Damage manifests. The mechanism operates through mental domination creating physical consequence.

Mordecai's experiments quantified the practical difference: "I animated twelve skeletons over one hour with minimal exhaustion, but when I manifested three phantoms simultaneously my mind collapsed at seventeen minutes. I couldn't maintain a fourth phantom even though I tried. The mathematics clearly favor skeletons for sustained combat, and the data is conclusive. Phantoms are a tactical novelty, not a primary deployment method."
## Combat Mechanics
Attack patterns repeat identically, creating predictability that skilled opponents exploit. Superior numbers compensate by overwhelming any tactical adaptation.

Both skeletons and phantoms can be positioned between enemy and animator to absorb damage. Constructs are expendable. The animator is not. Mordecai's demonstrations repeatedly emphasize this asymmetry.
## Combat Limitations
Unholy magic's combat effectiveness faces clear constraints. Constructs cannot adapt or learn. Imprinted directives execute exactly as shaped, requiring new imprints when battlefield conditions change. No healing or self-repair exists.

Living opponents present a greater challenge than dead matter. Minds resist imposed directives, requiring active contest of wills with no guarantee of success.

Environmental limitations matter. Skeleton animation requires corpses. Battlefields provide abundant material. Sterile environments limit deployment. Though Mordecai notes: "Forward planning solves this! Transport corpses in wagons. Establish supply lines like any military operation. I filled a cart with thirty-seven skeletons once, transported them fifteen miles, animated on arrival. The horses were nervous but efficient. Engineering problem, not magical limitation. Creative logistics yield tactical flexibility."

Practitioner capacity constrains extended engagements. The trade-off between directive complexity and mental strain applies throughout combat.
## Tactical Deployment
Maximize numerical advantage. Animate or summon as many constructs as will allows. Replace fallen constructs during engagement if mental capacity permits.

Maintain distance. Let constructs engage. The practitioner directs from safety. Mid-combat summoning requires channeling magic and infusing it with personal will, not stored sources. Pre-combat preparation proves more reliable.

Mordecai summarizes deployment philosophy: "Build twenty skeletons with simple attack directives! Not five with complex tactical awareness. I tested this extensively. Twenty simpler constructs? I animated them in forty minutes with brief recovery between each. Five complex constructs? Took three hours and left me exhausted. Enemy can't process that many targets. Optimization favors quantity over sophistication. Always. The mathematics are irrefutable and the results are delightful."
