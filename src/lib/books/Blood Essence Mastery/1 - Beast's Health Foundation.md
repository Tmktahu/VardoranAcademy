## How This Formula Developed
I need to be honest with you: I didn't develop the elixir formulations. That honor belongs to Theresa Proudmoore, who joined Academy faculty in AD 72 and immediately started doing things with Greater Blood Essence that frankly made the rest of us look incompetent.

Greater Blood Essence concentrates vampiric life force into stable material form. I'd been trying to use it in preparations for years with minimal success, mostly because I kept treating it like standard reagent. Theresa understood it as carrier medium for other magical properties. Once blood essence stabilizes a formula, you can introduce plant-based effects that would otherwise degrade too quickly.

This elixir combines snow flower and hell's clarion, which are two plants with opposed natures. Snow flower's frost affinity normally cancels hell's clarion's chaos properties. But blood essence holds them in suspension, allowing both to work synergistically. The result: simultaneous health increase and enhanced healing reception. Theory says this shouldn't work. Practice says it absolutely does.

Theresa developed eight elixir formulations total. I'm documenting them for Academy records since she refuses to write them down herself. "Just tell people how to make them," she insists. So here I am, telling you.
## The Formula
**Ingredients:**
- 20 measures snow flower
- 20 measures hell's clarion
- 1 Greater Blood Essence
- 1 empty glass bottle

**Preparation:**
Grind snow flower and hell's clarion separately. Don't combine them yet because they'll react poorly if mixed before essence addition.

Dissolve Greater Blood Essence in minimal water, creating concentrated carrier solution. This takes longer than you'd expect; the essence resists dissolution. Gentle heat helps but don't boil it.

Once essence fully dissolves, add ground snow flower first. Stir until suspension forms because the mixture should turn pale blue. Then add ground hell's clarion. The color will shift to muddy purple as both plants integrate into essence matrix. Continue stirring for five minutes as the suspension stabilizes.

Transfer to glass bottle immediately. The formula degrades rapidly if left exposed to air. Sealed properly, it maintains potency for several weeks.

**Effect:**
One bottle provides 24 hours of enhanced vitality. You'll experience two distinct effects: increased maximum health (roughly 10% above baseline) and improved healing reception (approximately 12% boost to all healing effects). The combination makes you both harder to kill and easier to repair.
## Practical Uses
Military applications are obvious. Soldiers expecting heavy combat benefit enormously from both increased health and healing enhancement. The formula essentially makes you tougher while making your healers more effective.

Explorers venturing into dangerous territory often carry multiple bottles. The dual protection provides margin of safety when far from proper medical facilities.

Interestingly, some Academy researchers use it when conducting hazardous experiments. The increased health provides buffer against accidents, while enhanced healing helps recovery from inevitable workshop disasters. Theresa suggests I might benefit from this approach, which I find unnecessarily personal.

Arena combatants favor this elixir for obvious reasons. More health to lose plus better healing creates significant competitive advantage.
## Theresa's Development Notes
(I'm including these because they explain her thinking better than I could paraphrase)

"Malcolm kept trying to combine plants directly with blood essence, then wondering why everything precipitated out. Blood essence doesn't blend properties; it suspends them. You're not making mixture; you're making emulsion. Treat it like oil and water, not like tea and sugar.

The snow flower/hell's clarion pairing works because their opposing natures create stable suspension when held in essence. They're trying to cancel each other, which keeps both in active state indefinitely. If they actually interacted, the formula would fail. The whole point is maintaining opposition.

I tested forty-seven plant combinations before finding ones that worked. Most just degraded. Some produced violent reactions, and Malcolm's eyebrows still haven't fully recovered from the fire blossom/mourning lily attempt. The eight successful formulations represent massive trial and error process. Don't assume you'll discover new ones easily."
## Important Warnings
Greater Blood Essence is expensive and difficult to obtain. Don't waste it on practice batches. Read this entire entry, understand the process, then attempt preparation. Theresa gets irritated when people waste essence on preventable failures.

The muddy purple color is correct. Clear purple means you didn't fully integrate hell's clarion. Dark brown means you overheated the essence. Either indicates failed batch, so discard and start over.

Don't attempt to double the effect by drinking two bottles. Theresa tested this extensively. Result: no additional benefit, significant nausea, waste of expensive materials.

Store away from extreme temperatures. Blood essence remains stable in normal conditions but breaks down rapidly in heat or freezing cold.
