## How I Developed This Formula
I need to address this directly: this formula exists primarily for documenting dangerous practice rather than encouraging it. Irradiant Gruel increases prisoner blood quality but carries significant mutation risk. The ethics are questionable at best.

The formula emerged from examining plague brier's mutagenic properties when combined with mutant grease. Both materials carry transformative compounds, which include plague brier from chemical contamination and mutant grease from biological mutation. Together, they create substance that dramatically alters subject physiology.

In controlled doses, this increases blood quality as subject's body adapts to mutagenic stress. Unfortunately, approximately 35% of subjects undergo uncontrolled transformation into raging mutants. This represents unacceptable risk for what amounts to marginal blood quality improvement.

I include this formula for academic completeness and explicit warning. If you're considering using this, please reconsider. The mutation risk creates serious ethical and practical problems.
## The Formula
**Ingredients:**
- 20 measures plague brier
- 20 measures mutant grease
- Note: No container specified because this is not consumed by user

**Preparation:**
Grind plague brier flowers thoroughly. Process mutant grease into liquid form through gentle heating because it solidifies at room temperature but liquefies easily. Combine ground plague brier with liquefied mutant grease while stirring constantly.

The mixture forms thick, unpleasant paste. The combination smells terrible and maintains disturbing greenish-brown color. This is normal for materials derived from chemical contamination and biological mutation.

**Administration:**
This is fed to prisoners, not consumed by vampires. Small amounts mixed into prisoner food provide mutagenic exposure. The subject processes compounds over several days, during which blood quality increases by 1-2%.

**Mutation Risk:**
35% chance subject transforms into raging mutant. The transformation occurs unpredictably, which means it might happen immediately or might occur days later. Transformed subjects become violent, lose sapience, require immediate containment or elimination.
## Why This Exists
Vampire operations requiring high-quality blood sometimes resort to this despite risks. The blood quality increase represents meaningful improvement for certain blood-dependent processes. Some vampires consider 35% loss rate acceptable for 65% success rate.

I document this because pretending the practice doesn't exist won't stop it. Better to provide accurate information including risks than allow uninformed experimentation with even worse outcomes.

The Academy's position: we neither encourage nor support this application. We document it for academic record while strongly recommending against use.
## The Mutation Mechanism
The mutagenic transformation appears related to subject's adaptive response to combined chemical and biological stressors. Most subjects adapt successfully, increasing blood vitality through stress response. Minority undergo catastrophic adaptation failure resulting in uncontrolled mutation.

No reliable predictors exist for which subjects will transform. Age, health, and species all do not correlate meaningfully with mutation risk. The 35% appears essentially random, making risk mitigation impossible beyond simply not using the formula.

Transformed subjects demonstrate:
- Extreme aggression
- Loss of higher cognitive function
- Enhanced physical strength
- Resistance to restraint
- No apparent pain response

These characteristics make transformed subjects dangerous to handlers and surrounding personnel. Containment proves difficult, elimination often becomes necessary.
## Ethical Considerations
Using sapient beings as blood farms already occupies morally questionable territory. Adding 35% chance of transforming them into mindless mutants for marginal blood quality improvement crosses additional ethical lines.

Some argue prisoners are already condemned, making mutation risk irrelevant. I reject this reasoning. Condemned status doesn't justify subjecting people to transformation into monsters for convenience.

Others claim the blood quality improvement serves important purposes justifying risks. I remain unconvinced marginal improvements warrant such extreme measures.

My personal stance: this formula should not be used. I've documented it for academic completeness and explicit warning, not as encouragement.
## Development History
I didn't set out to create this. Initial experiments examined plague brier's mutagenic properties for understanding chemical contamination effects. Mutant grease entered testing when searching for materials that might moderate plague brier's reactivity.

The combination's effect on blood quality emerged accidentally during safety testing on exposed subjects. The mutation risk became apparent simultaneously. Both discoveries occurred in same experimental series, immediately establishing that any benefit came with severe cost.

I debated whether to document this at all. Decided that acknowledging reality serves better than pretending dangerous practices don't exist. If vampires will use mutagenic substances on prisoners regardless, better they understand actual risks than experiment blindly.
## Important Warnings
If you disregard ethical concerns and use this anyway:

Monitor subjects constantly after administration. Transformation can occur without warning. Have containment protocols ready.

Never use on subjects in unsecured locations. Transformed mutants in uncontrolled settings create disasters.

The blood quality increase is modest, at 1-2% maximum. Weigh this carefully against 35% chance of losing subject entirely plus handling transformed mutant.

No antidote exists. Once transformation begins, it cannot be stopped or reversed. Transformed subjects remain mutants permanently.

Consider alternatives. Standard prisoner care and feeding provides reliable blood quality without mutation risks. Patience often serves better than dangerous shortcuts.
