## Injection Sensing Technique
Storm mages can inject storm magic into other magical constructs and feel their structure through flow patterns. This capability follows directly from everything you learned about flow expertise. You add small amounts of energy to existing magical systems and observe how those systems handle the new input. The flow patterns reveal structure and design.

Think of water flowing through hidden channels. You cannot see the walls or passages directly, but by observing how water moves through them, you map their layout and purpose. Storm magic works the same way. You inject energy into a blood ward, an illusion construct, or any magical device. The energy integrates into their flow patterns. You perceive those patterns and understand how the construct functions without ever touching it directly.

This is not control. If you think storm magic can redirect or manipulate other disciplines' workings, you are thinking wrong. Injection sensing provides understanding, not influence. You observe structure, map design, identify function, nothing more. This analytical capability extends beyond combat applications and represents storm magic's primary non-combat tool. Storm practitioners become magical engineers not because we can direct other magic, but because we can understand it.
## Magical Construct Analysis
Flow patterns map function and reveal purpose. Once you perceive how energy moves through a construct, you identify its structural composition rather than its external effects. You trace where energy enters, how it moves through the system, what it powers, where it exits. This understanding enables accurate analysis without disruption.

This is magical engineering in its purest form. Storm mages excel at diagnosing magical problems because we understand systems through their flow, not their outputs. When a ward fails or a ritual malfunctions, practitioners from other disciplines see broken effect. We see disrupted flow. The diagnosis comes from identifying where the flow breaks down, why it fails to reach its destination, what blocked or redirected the intended pathway.

This analytical capability requires complete separation between observation and modification. You cannot analyze what you try to control. Storm practitioners who attempt to restructure other disciplines' magic through flow analysis fail spectacularly. The value comes from understanding others' working systems precisely, then collaborating with those specialists to optimize energy flow. This makes storm practitioners exceptional at dissecting and analyzing magical constructs - we identify problems through flow disruption rather than attempting to modify specialized workings we do not control.
## Partner School in Multi-School Rituals
Storm magic contributes raw energy to multi-school rituals alongside contributions from other disciplines. Other disciplines bring specialized effects and their own energy - blood magic for binding, illusion for pattern construction, chaos for erasure. Storm contributes additional power and flow precision. This distinction should be clear. If you think storm magic can create those specialized effects, you misunderstand storm magic's nature.

Storm practitioners act as energy managers in collaborative workings. We understand how to direct energy flow efficiently, where power needs to go, how different energy sources interact. Storm magic can interact with other schools in unexpected ways - energy seeking paths of least resistance does not always align with another discipline's intended structure. Flow precision allows optimizing energy distribution across complex ritual structures. A sanguine specialist binds energies, we ensure our flow integrates properly. An illusion specialist constructs patterns, we provide additional energy without disrupting their creation.

The value comes from enhancing others' work without interfering. Storm magic alone cannot achieve binding, transmutation, or complex pattern effects. We provide additional energy to operations that require it. This requires understanding not only others' needs but how different magical energies interact. Without that understanding, you disrupt their workings in unpredictable ways. Storm mastery ensures our energy integrates where intended, in the right amount, without interference. Storm excels at collaborative provision and optimization, nothing more.
## Transcendum Technology Principles
Transcendum scientists use mundane lightning as power source. Storm mages channel magical energy that manifests in identical form. Both recognize lightning as the purest form of energy. That shared manifestation principle explains why Transcendum technology shares patterns with magical constructs in structure and function. Electricity flows through their constructs the way magical energy flows through wards and spells. This represents the most significant overlap between magic and technology.

Experiments powering mundane Transcendum devices with storm magic typically fail. Pure magical energy overwhelms mundane materials, destroying simple conductive components. Success has been achieved by reconstructing devices with materials capable of conducting magical energy. The engineering principles transfer, but proper materials must be utilized.
## Theoretical Boundaries of Ritual Applications
Storm magic cannot create ritual effects requiring specialization. Transmutation, sustained wards, permanent enchantments - these belong to other disciplines entirely. Do not attempt to substitute energy for specialized magical functions. Storm enhances what exists. It does not transform what does not.

Flow understanding does not grant control over other disciplines' workings. Even when analysis reveals vulnerabilities, storm practitioners cannot break or disrupt those workings. Injection sensing reveals structure, but structure alone does not permit modification. These limitations follow naturally from pure energy's fundamental nature. Energy moves and enhances. It does not specialize, transform, or sustain. Understanding this distinction separates collaborative success from catastrophic failure.
