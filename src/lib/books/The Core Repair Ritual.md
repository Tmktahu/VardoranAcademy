# The Core Repair Ritual

## Fundamental Theories
A magical core is not a vessel that can be filled and emptied at will. It is a self-sustaining, intrinsic part of a living being, as natural and essential as the heart that moves blood through the body. Every living creature possesses one. It contains some or all of the magical schools, and in a healthy individual, it maintains itself without conscious effort.

The core's schools are not interchangeable. Each one carries the signature of the being it belongs to, and this signature matters deeply when treatment is needed. For outside magic to be accepted by a core, it must be introduced in a way the core recognizes as familiar. The method for this is what I call keying: foreign magic must be wrapped in a thin sheath of magic already native to the core, ideally drawn from the same school, before the core will accept it as its own rather than expel it as foreign matter.

This principle governs everything that follows.
## When This Ritual Is Needed
Core damage falls into two categories. A school may be weakened, reduced in capacity, or partially depleted. Alternatively, a school may be absent entirely, whether through injury, ritual extraction, or a condition the patient was born with or has since developed.

Both can be addressed. The process for each differs in its opening steps, but converges from the third stage onward.
## Materials and Participants
The ritual requires a careful arrangement of prepared materials around the patient. These materials act as reserve sources from which participating casters can draw during the procedure. The arrangement must form a self-reinforcing geometric pattern: a circle, triangle, pentagon, or similar closed shape. This is not ceremonial preference. The geometry ensures the material energies feed back into one another rather than dispersing outward, keeping them available for the duration of the working.

Charged gemstones aligned to the relevant school are the primary focus material. Witchdust has proven a useful amplifier for the weaving stages. Miststone, when charged, assists in stabilizing what has been woven before acceptance occurs. The specific quantities depend on how many schools require repair and how severely each is damaged.

Casters capable of working with holy and shadow magic are strongly preferred for the wrapping stage. Any skilled caster of the appropriate school may participate.

For those who carry a binding to a Leviathan: additional magic of the bound school is recommended during the acceptance stage, as it appears to ease the core's recognition of the offered material.
## The Procedure
### Stage One: Frame Establishment
This stage applies only when a school is entirely absent from the patient's core. If the school is damaged but present, proceed to Stage Two.

When a school is missing, there is nothing within the core for foreign magic to key against. A frame must be built first, something the threadweave of Stage Two can attach to. This frame may come from two sources.

The first is a seedbearer's half-wheel, if one is available and willing to contribute a portion of their own core structure for this purpose. The second is an extension of the caster's most powerful school, offered deliberately from their own magic and shaped to serve as a provisional anchor within the patient's core.

The frame is temporary scaffolding. It does not become part of the patient permanently. Its purpose is to give the threads of Stage Two something to hold.
### Stage Two: Threadweaving
Between the structural spokes of the frame, or between the existing schools of the core when no frame was needed, participating casters must weave fine threads of like-school magic drawn from the core's own remaining material. These threads must be close-knit and precise. Their purpose is to create a catching structure within the core that will receive and hold the foreign magic introduced in Stage Three.

These threads, once made, are permanent. They leave a thin but lasting structure within the core, like the finest stitching in cloth. They do not interfere with normal function. They become part of the core's internal architecture.

If a school is entirely absent, the threads are woven differently. All remaining schools within the patient's core are drawn together alongside outside magic of the missing school, producing entropic threads that carry the character of every school while remaining keyed to the patient's native signature. This dual nature is what allows the core to later recognize and accept the foreign magic introduced in the following stages.

If entropic magic is already present within the patient's core, a rotling or otherwise capable manipulator of entropy should weave native entropic threads for this purpose rather than constructing them from the patient's remaining schools.

Threads woven at this stage are left latent. The working may pause here safely. A patient may return at a later time to complete Stages Three through Five.
### Stage Three: Introduction of Foreign Magic
From this point forward, each missing or damaged school must be completed in a single sitting. Do not attempt more than one school per session. The process is taxing for both patient and casters, and attempting multiple schools consecutively risks rejection or instability.

Participating casters must introduce outside magic of the appropriate school into the vicinity of the core with great delicacy. The source may be the caster's own core, the willing contribution of other beings present, or a prepared focus. Precision is more important than force. The goal is to bring a sufficient quantity of like-school magic into proximity with the patient's core, where it can be guided in the following stage. The amount needed will vary depending on the strength of the remaining core and the extent of the damage.
### Stage Four: Wrapping
With foreign magic now present and available near the core, a skilled caster of the thread-type school must guide it carefully into the threads woven in Stage Two. The magic is pressed into the threads, held there, and bound. The caster must work methodically: close each thread fully, tie it back to the core's existing structure, knit the threads together as one would close a seam.

When done correctly, the result is a permanent threadlike structure atop the repaired school, a stitch visible in the core's architecture to anyone who knows how to look. The binding does not overwrite the core. It joins it.
### Stage Five: Acceptance
The final stage cannot be forced. The core must recognize the introduced magic as its own for the repair to hold. This is not something casters can compel. They can only complete the work of Stages Three and Four with care and hope that the conditions have been created correctly.

A core may accept the new magic quickly, granting the patient partial or full use of the repaired school within a short time. It may also take time before results become apparent. In some cases, the core may reject the introduced magic entirely.

If rejection occurs, the threadweaves from Stage Two must be cut away immediately. Speed is essential here. Allowing rejected material to remain risks harm to the core's native schools. Once the threads are removed, the patient's core should be allowed to stabilize before any attempt is repeated.

Casters who contributed their own magic to build the threads in Stage Two will notice a minor decrease in that school's casting capacity afterward. This is expected and typically resolves over time.
## A Note on Patience
It is my strong recommendation not to attempt this ritual for more than one school in a single sitting, even when circumstances seem to demand urgency. The body and the core both need time to process what has been done to them. Rushing this work does not serve the patient. It serves the anxiety of those around them.

I have seen cores accept repair quietly over the course of weeks. I have seen them reject magic within seconds. Both outcomes deserve to be met with steadiness. If you are performing this ritual, bring that steadiness with you.
