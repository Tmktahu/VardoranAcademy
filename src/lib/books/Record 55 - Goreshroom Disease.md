## Subjects
- Mycruor Infection pathogen characteristics
- Nociceptive dysfunction and cognitive effects
- Fungal fruiting wound response mechanisms
- Systemic fungicide treatment protocols
## Observations
Mycotic infection affecting vampiric populations exclusively. Mycruor spores resemble blood cells, evading routine diagnostics and magical detection. Variable incubation from days to months before symptomatic presentation.
### Transmission and Infection
Primary routes include blood contact, bites from infected individuals, consumption of infected blood/meat products, and ingestion of raw Mycruor mushroom specimens. Secondary transmission through spore inhalation with reduced efficiency. Direct bloodstream introduction provides 90% infection probability.

Mycelia establish circulatory system colonization through anchoring mechanisms preventing removal. Small spore quantities release into salivary glands and blood circulation, suggesting possible internal mushroom fruiting.
### Clinical Presentation
**Primary Symptoms:** Complete pain elimination while maintaining other sensory modalities. Exception documented for thermal damage from solar exposure, incendiary sources, and chaos flame applications. This selective dysfunction serves pathogen survival mechanisms.

**Cognitive and Behavioral Effects:** Progressive disorientation with episodic memory dysfunction creating temporal lapses from minutes to hours. Behavioral alterations encourage aggressive responses toward allies and potential hosts. Impaired threat assessment capabilities and reduced self-preservation instincts increase risk-taking behavior despite injuries.

**Hematologic Effects:** Accelerated coagulation response, complete cessation of regenerative healing processes, and compromised hemostatic regulation. Blood specimens retain infectivity for extended periods.
### Pathophysiology
Chemical agents released by mycelia disable pain receptors through neural pathway interference and alter cognitive function via neurotransmitter manipulation. Suspected evolutionary function involves encouraging continued combat activity and promoting aggressive behavior toward transmission targets.
### Wound Response and Fungal Characteristics
Any laceration exposing mycelia to atmosphere triggers rapid mushroom fruiting that halts bleeding through complete wound sealing but prevents therapeutic healing. Mechanical removal creates space for immediate regrowth within minutes.

Mushroom maturation occurs within 1-2 vampiric turns with consistent morphology. Healing potions and salves completely ineffective, potentially due to mycelia interference with magical healing mechanisms.

**Culinary Properties:** Cooked specimens resemble beef despite "chicken" designation. Preparation requires 250°F internal temperature minimum to eliminate spores and mycelia. Properly prepared specimens safe for consumption.
### Treatment Protocols
**Systemic Fungicide Therapy (Primary):** Injectable compounds once per vampiric cycle for 2-4 cycles or until blood fails to produce mushrooms when exposed to atmosphere. Side effects vary significantly by compound selection. Patient monitoring essential throughout treatment.

Nociceptive function returns abruptly following complete elimination, typically after second or third treatment. Patients require preparation for sudden pain restoration and supportive analgesic protocols during recovery.

**Complete Thermal Destruction (Extreme Cases):** Sustained chaos flame to complete ash reduction. 100% pathogen elimination but extremely low survival probability. Solar exposure insufficient due to rapid host mortality. Necrotic flame ineffective. Partial treatment causes rapid recolonization.

**Medical Personnel Safety:** Respiratory protection essential during mushroom removal. Specialized containment for wound examination.
