# Construct 05: Rejuvenation Juice

## Purpose
To document the alchemical formula for a potent healing compound designed for rapid deployment in combat or emergency situations. The substance provides immediate regenerative effects upon impact, creating an effective healing agent suitable for thrown deployment in sealed containers. Functions similarly to blood rose potions but with enhanced delivery mechanism for field use.
## Materials
### Primary Components
- **1 Part Venom Sap** (quantity varies by batch size)
  - Provides the reactive mechanism for burst deployment
  - Reality-warping properties allow for enhanced absorption of healing compounds

- **10 Parts Blood Roses** (concentrated extract)
  - Contains primary healing essence in stable form
  - Known regenerative properties provide the core therapeutic effect

- **5 Parts Blood Essence** (purified concentrate)
  - Amplifies and sustains the healing reaction
  - Enhances the penetration and effectiveness of blood rose extract
  - Provides the binding agent that allows healing compounds to adhere and absorb effectively
### Container Requirements
- **Sealed Vessel** (glass preferred)
  - Must maintain compound integrity during storage and transport
  - Designed for controlled breach upon impact to maximize healing coverage
## Preparation Process
### Phase 1: Component Preparation
Blood roses must be carefully processed to extract and concentrate the healing essence while preserving therapeutic properties. Extraction requires maintaining specific temperature to prevent degradation of active compounds.

Blood essence undergoes purification to remove impurities and concentrate regenerative properties. This creates a stable base that can effectively bind with and amplify the blood rose extract.
### Phase 2: Mixture Assembly
Combine blood rose extract with purified blood essence in precise ratios to create the healing matrix. Venom sap is then carefully integrated as the delivery mechanism. Its warping properties allow the healing compound to disperse rapidly and penetrate effectively upon deployment.

**Critical Preparation Note**: The venom sap must be added last and mixed thoroughly to ensure even distribution. The compound becomes impact-reactive once venom sap is incorporated, requiring careful handling to prevent premature activation.
### Phase 3: Container Sealing
Transfer completed mixture to deployment containers while maintaining sealed environment. Containers must be designed for optimal dispersion upon impact while preventing degradation during storage or accidental activation during transport.
## Observed Properties
### Healing Characteristics
Upon impact, the venom sap's warping effect triggers rapid dispersion of the healing mixture, creating a therapeutic effect. The blood rose extract provides immediate regenerative benefits while the blood essence amplifies and sustains the healing process. The compound adheres to living tissue and absorbs quickly, providing healing effects comparable to direct blood rose potion consumption.
### Storage Stability
When properly sealed, rejuvenation juice maintains healing potency for extended periods. No significant degradation of therapeutic properties observed in sealed samples after prolonged storage.
### Deployment Considerations
The substance is designed for thrown deployment in breakable containers. Impact activation allows immediate dispersion of healing compounds at point of delivery. Effective range and coverage area depend on container design and deployment method. Most effective when deployed against living targets in need of healing.
## Safety Warnings
- **Handle containers carefully to prevent premature activation**
- **Ensure proper sealing to maintain compound integrity**
- **Deployment on hostile targets may provide unintended healing benefits**
