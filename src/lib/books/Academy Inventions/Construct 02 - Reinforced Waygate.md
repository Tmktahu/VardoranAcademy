# Construct 02: Reinforced Waygate – Structurally Enhanced Castle Waygate
_Written by Zrott, 803 AD_
## Purpose
To document the construction of an enhanced Castle Waygate specifically designed with superior structural integrity and magical conductivity. The reinforced design incorporates metallic strengthening materials and improved magical channeling components to sustain higher magical throughput and operational strain compared to standard Waygate constructions.
## Materials
### Baseline Castle Waygate Components
- **Blood Essence** (100 units)
  - Links the Waygate directly to the castle heart
  - Provides vampiric resonance for portal activation
- **Gem Dust** (20 units)
  - Used for runic inscriptions and magical carvings
  - Enhances magical conductivity throughout the structure
- **Stone Bricks** (12 units)
  - Forms the foundational structural framework
  - Provides basic Waygate archway construction
- **Grave Dust** (4 units)
  - Essential component for runic work and mystical carvings
  - Enhances resonance within Waygate matrix
### Reinforcement Materials
- **Darksilver Ingots** (100 units)
  - Secondary strongest metal available for construction
  - Provides superior structural reinforcement over stone foundation
  - Enhances overall Waygate durability and load tolerance
- **Iron Ingots** (100 units)
  - Additional structural reinforcement for baseline framework
  - Supplements stone brick foundation with metallic strengthening
- **Gold Ingots** (50 units)
  - Acts as magical conductor throughout the enhanced structure
  - Facilitates improved magical channeling and reduced energy loss
- **Onyx Tier** (1 unit)
  - Installed at the central connection point
  - Reinforces the direct ley line interface and portal stabilization
## Assembly Process
### Phase 1: Enhanced Foundation
Begin with standard stone brick foundation, but reinforce each joint and connection point with iron ingot reinforcement. The iron provides additional structural stability that prevents stress fractures under heavy magical load.
### Phase 2: Darksilver Framework
Overlay the iron-reinforced stone foundation with darksilver framework. The darksilver serves as the primary structural enhancement, providing strength that exceeds standard stone construction by significant margins.
### Phase 3: Magical Conduction Integration
Install gold ingot channels throughout the framework to create enhanced magical pathways. The gold facilitates smoother magical flow and reduces energy loss during Waygate operation.
### Phase 4: Runic and Mystical Work
Apply gem dust and grave dust for standard runic inscriptions and mystical carvings as per baseline Waygate specifications. The enhanced framework provides superior stability for detailed runic work.
### Phase 5: Central Ley Connection
Install the onyx tier component at the central connection point. This reinforces the direct interface with ley line energy and provides stabilization for high-throughput magical operations.
### Phase 6: Blood Essence Integration
Complete the construction with blood essence integration to establish castle heart connection. The enhanced framework allows for more stable blood essence distribution throughout the structure.
## Observed Properties
### Enhanced Durability
The reinforced construction demonstrates significantly improved structural integrity compared to standard Waygate designs. The combination of darksilver and iron reinforcement provides resistance to both physical stress and magical strain.
### Improved Magical Throughput
Gold conductor integration results in measurably improved magical flow efficiency. The enhanced conductivity allows for higher magical throughput without corresponding increases in energy loss or structural stress.
### Stabilized Ley Connection
The onyx tier central component provides enhanced ley line interface stability. Initial testing suggests reduced fluctuation in connection strength and improved consistency in transport reliability.
