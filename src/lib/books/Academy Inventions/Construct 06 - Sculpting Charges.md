# Construct 06: Sculpting Charges
-# _Developed by The Academy, 201 AMR_
## Purpose
Directional explosive device for clearing collapsed rubble from archaeological sites, structural excavations, and damaged buildings requiring repair. Controlled directional force pulverizes and disperses fragmented material while preserving intact structural elements.

NOT a siege device. Testing confirms ineffectiveness against solid walls or fortifications. The device lacks sufficient force to compromise cohesive materials. Application limited to material that has already undergone structural failure.
## Materials
### Explosive Core
- **Minor Explosive** - central core providing base detonation force
- **Sulphur** - packed around explosive with concentration near front aperture to augment directional force projection
### Structural Reinforcement
- **Iron Casing** - wraps explosive core, five sealed faces with single open aperture, channels force directionally
### Embedded Gemstones
- **Charged Regular Sapphires** (frost-aspected)
  - Embedded in rear face of iron casing
  - Absorbs and cushions backward explosive force
  - Prevents recoil and device displacement
- **Charged Crude Amethysts** (chaos-aspected)
  - Embedded in iron casing along aperture channel
  - Actively disperses fragmented particles
  - Prevents debris accumulation in blast path
## Assembly Process
### Phase 1: Core Preparation
Minor explosive positioned as central component. Sulphur packed around explosive, concentrated near front to augment directional force projection. Consistent packing density required to prevent uneven detonation patterns.
### Phase 2: Casing Fabrication and Gemstone Embedding
Iron casing fabricated with five sealed faces and one aperture. Frost-charged sapphires embedded in rear face opposite aperture. Chaos-charged amethysts embedded along aperture channel walls. Gemstone positioning critical... improper placement causes asymmetric force distribution and device rotation during detonation.
### Phase 3: Core Integration and Sealing
Prepared explosive core inserted into gemstone-embedded casing. Assembly sealed to prevent premature ignition or environmental degradation. Aperture must face target rubble during deployment.
## Observed Properties
### Directional Force Projection
Successful directional blast cone approximately 15-20 degrees wide. Explosive force concentrated through aperture with minimal lateral dispersion. Embedded sapphires effectively contain backward force... no significant recoil when properly secured.
### Debris Clearing Capability
Embedded amethysts provide effective particle dispersion, extending range approximately 30-40% beyond unenhanced charges. Primary applications: archaeological excavation, structural debris removal, and clearing collapsed building sections to enable repairs. Device excels at clearing fragmented material, rubble piles, and collapsed masonry.
### Critical Limitation
INEFFECTIVE against intact structural elements. Testing against solid walls, fortifications, and load-bearing columns produced negligible damage. This limitation is intentional... design prioritizes precision clearing over destructive power. Using Sculpting Charges against fortifications wastes materials without tactical benefit.
### Activation Requirements
Requires pinpoint activation of explosive core via precise spell targeting, arrow impact with sufficient penetration, or direct physical ignition. Area-effect magic produces unreliable results.
## Notes for Further Study
- Optimal sulphur concentration and positioning for various rubble compositions
- Multi-charge deployment patterns for extensive sites
- Standardized mounting brackets for stable positioning
