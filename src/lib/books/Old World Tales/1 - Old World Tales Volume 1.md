## The Frozen Climber

There once was a vampire who heard tales from northern travelers. They spoke of a power in the high peaks that tested the worthy. The vampire, confident in his strength and immortality, decided to seek it out.

He climbed for three days through ice and wind. At the summit, he called out his challenge.

The wind answered, though whether the words came from outside or inside his own mind, he could not say: "You do not feel the cold. How can you endure what you cannot experience?"

The vampire argued that feeling was irrelevant. He was strong. He was here. He had proven himself.

"You have proven only that you are already dead," the wind replied.

When mountain folk found him days later, he stood frozen mid-step on the path. His eyes were open. The cold had not killed him, but something had stopped him nonetheless. They left him there as a warning.

Some say he stands there still.
## The House That Remembered

There was once a house where seven generations of the same family had lived. The walls had absorbed so many memories that they began to echo them back.

At first it was subtle. A child's laughter when no child was present. The smell of bread baking in an empty kitchen. Footsteps on stairs when everyone was asleep.

Then the echoes grew stronger. Visitors would see people who weren't there. Conversations from decades past would repeat in empty rooms. The house showed you its history whether you wanted to see it or not.

The family tried to leave, but found they couldn't. Every road away led back to the front door. Every map showed their destination as the house itself.

"We fed it too much," the eldest grandmother said. "Houses aren't meant to remember this much. Now it thinks we're part of its memory, and memories don't get to leave."

They say the family still lives there. Or perhaps the house simply remembers them so vividly that it doesn't notice the difference.
## The Bridge of Bones

Long ago, a great river divided two kingdoms. Neither side could cross to trade or make peace. Many attempted to build bridges, but the river claimed every structure and every builder.

A wandering engineer offered to build a bridge that would never fall, but demanded a price: the first soul to cross it would belong to her.

The desperate kings agreed.

The engineer worked for seven years. She used no ordinary materials... the supports were carved from ancient trees that had never seen sunlight, the stones were quarried from a mountain said to house the dead, and the mortar was mixed with water from a well that reflected no sky.

Her assistants whispered that she worked with the dead themselves. That corpses carried the stones. That she would stand at the construction site and speak to nothing, yet receive answers.

When finished, the bridge stood perfect and immovable. The river raged beneath it but could not shake a single stone.

The engineer waited on the far side for her payment. The kings, clever men both, sent across a dog.

The engineer laughed. "A dog is not a soul," she said. "But a bargain is a bargain." She took the animal and left, though some claimed dark thorns protruded from her skin as she walked away.

The bridge stands to this day. Some travelers report hearing weeping from beneath it when they cross. Others claim the stones are warmer than they should be, as if something living sleeps within them. And on certain nights, people swear they see figures moving in the supports... not shadows, but the pale shapes of the dead, still carrying stones, still building, forever.
## The Miller's Daughter

A miller had a beautiful daughter who could spin straw into gold thread. At least, that's what he told everyone. In truth, she was simply very good with a spinning wheel and golden dye, but her father's boasts grew with each retelling.

Word reached the local lord, who demanded the girl spin an entire room of straw into gold by morning, or be executed for her father's lies.

The girl wept, knowing she could not. At midnight, a small grey man appeared in the locked room.

"I can spin straw to gold," he said. "What will you give me?"

She gave him her necklace. He spun all night, and by morning the room gleamed with golden thread.

The lord was amazed and demanded she do it again, with twice as much straw. The grey man returned, and she gave him her ring. Again, he spun all night.

The third night, the lord demanded three rooms be filled. The girl had nothing left to give.

"Then promise me your firstborn child," the grey man said.

Desperate, she agreed.

Years later, now married to the lord, she bore a son. The grey man appeared to claim his payment.

"Please," she begged. "Anything but my child."

"Very well," he said. "Guess my name in three days, and you may keep the boy."

She sent messengers across the land gathering names. On the third day, one returned with a strange tale: he'd seen a small grey man dancing around a fire, singing, "Tomorrow the child I'll claim, for no one knows Rumpelstiltskin is my name!"

When the grey man came, she spoke his name. He shrieked in rage and vanished, never to be seen again.

Her son grew up healthy and strong, though he never learned what his mother had traded for his life, or what darker bargain she might have made if she hadn't learned the name.
