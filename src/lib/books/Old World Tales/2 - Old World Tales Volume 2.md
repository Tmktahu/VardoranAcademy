## The Village That Prayed

In a village whose name has been forgotten, there lived a priest of remarkable devotion. His prayers to the gods filled the chapel from dawn to dusk. His congregation admired his faith and sought to match it.

One day, the priest felt the divine presence more strongly than ever before. Not the god he prayed to, but the act of prayer itself seemed to have weight. It filled him with such joy that he wept. He prayed harder, pouring more devotion into his worship. When the feeling returned, stronger still, he prayed even more fervently.

His congregation followed his example. Services stretched from hours to days. They forgot to eat. They forgot to sleep. Children were left unattended while parents knelt in ecstatic devotion to their deity.

"Can you not feel how close the divine has become?" they said to each other. "Every prayer makes it stronger. Every word of faith feeds something hungry for belief."

A traveling merchant passed through during this time. He reported that the faithful seemed almost drunk on worship. Their prayers had become frenzied, desperate, as if trying to satisfy something that could never be satisfied.

Within a season, the village was empty. The bodies were found kneeling, prayers on their lips, smiles on their faces. They had prayed themselves to death, believing they were serving their god. But some whispered that something else had grown fat on their devotion, something that fed on faith itself regardless of where it was directed.
## The Inventor's Star

A young inventor worked through the night on a device to capture lightning. She had forty years left at most. Sixty if fortune favored her. Time was her enemy, so she worked quickly, building and testing and failing and trying again.

One night during a storm, a stranger appeared in her workshop. He watched her work without speaking.

"Why the urgency?" he finally asked.

"Because I will die," she said without looking up. "My ideas die with me if I don't make them real. Better to build something imperfect than plan something perfect that never exists."

The stranger placed a hand on her shoulder. When he removed it, a small star remained upon her skin, glowing with internal light.

"Now you will see as I see," he said. "The paths of energy. The flow of potential. Use it well."

He left no other instructions. No demands. No warnings.

The inventor built greater things after that night. Her students claimed she could look at any device and understand its function instantly, as if she could see the energy moving through it.

When she died at sixty-three, her body bore dozens of burn scars in the shape of that original star. Her students buried her with honors, though none of them ever received similar gifts.
## The Whale and the Moon

Long ago, when the world was young, the moon fell in love with a whale.

Every night, the moon would descend closer to the ocean to watch the whale swim. The whale would leap from the water, trying to reach the moon. But no matter how high she jumped, she could not touch it.

"Come down to me," the whale called.

"I cannot," the moon replied. "If I touch the water, I will drown."

"Then I will come up to you," the whale said.

But whales cannot fly, no matter how hard they try.

They loved each other across the divide for many years. The moon pulled the tides, lifting the whale as high as the ocean could carry her. The whale sang songs that the moon felt as ripples in the water below.

Eventually, the moon's longing grew so great that he descended anyway, accepting his fate. He touched the water's surface, just once, exactly where the whale waited.

They say that's why the moon waxes and wanes... he drowns a little each month, weakening, before pulling himself back to the sky to recover. And they say the whale still waits at that same spot in the ocean, hoping for that brief moment of touch each cycle.

Sailors claim that on the night of the new moon, when the moon is darkest from drowning, you can hear a whale's song of longing carried on the wind.
## The Blacksmith's Heart

A blacksmith fell in love with a woman who had wandered down from the highest peaks. She was pale as snow, cold to the touch, and slowly weakening in the valley heat.

"I will die here," she told him. "The warmth is killing me. I belong in the cold, with others like me who endure the heights."

"Then I will make you a heart of iron," the blacksmith said, "and it will keep you cold forever."

He worked for seven days and seven nights. He forged a heart from the coldest iron he could find, quenched it in winter snow brought down from the peaks, and bound it with silver wire.

When he placed it in her chest, she gasped. The ice of her body hardened. She stopped melting. Her breath misted the air even in summer heat.

"You saved me," she said.

They married and lived together for many years. But over time, the blacksmith noticed that his wife grew colder. Not just her touch, but her nature. She spoke less. Smiled less. The warmth of affection drained from her eyes.

"What's happening to you?" he asked.

"The heart you gave me keeps me alive," she said, her voice flat. "But it knows only one thing: cold. It makes me colder each day, spreading its nature through me. Eventually, I will feel nothing but cold. No love. No warmth. No memory of you. Just the ability to endure, which is all the cold has ever asked of anyone."

"Then I'll remove it," the blacksmith said.

"Then I'll die," she replied.

He tried anyway, but found the heart had fused to her, become part of her, inseparable.

She returned to the mountains eventually, where others like her gathered in the heights. Those who could endure the cold not because they were numb to it, but because endurance itself had become their only remaining purpose.

The blacksmith never forged another heart. When asked why, he would only say: "Some gifts take more than they give. The cold demands everything, eventually. Even love."
