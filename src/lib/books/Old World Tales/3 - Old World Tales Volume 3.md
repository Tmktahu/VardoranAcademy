## The Merchant's Face
A Fae trickster, already skilled at wearing false faces, encountered a traveling merchant who dealt in identities rather than goods. The merchant could become anyone so seamlessly that observers forgot he had ever been someone else.

"Teach me," the Fae demanded.

The merchant smiled. "You change masks. I change who wears the mask. The difference is everything."

He touched her forehead. Small wisps of light appeared around her, visible only to her eyes.

"Now you can do more than pretend," he said. "You can make others forget you were ever pretending at all."

The Fae was delighted. She could create histories that never happened. She could become so thoroughly someone else that even her own memories shifted.

But after several weeks wearing a merchant's face, she tried to return to her original form and realized she couldn't remember what it looked like.

Every time she tried to recall it, the memory was different. All equally plausible. None feeling true.

She sought out the merchant in a panic, but he wore a face she didn't recognize. Or perhaps the same face. She couldn't be certain.

"Which face do you want?" he asked. "The one you wore at birth? Yesterday? Right now? They're all equally real. Or equally false. I've simply made you aware of it."

They say she still wanders, trying different faces, searching for the one that feels like home.

## The Girl Who Planted Stars
A human girl found a seed that glowed like starlight. She planted it in her garden and watered it carefully.

The seed grew into a tree with silver leaves. Each leaf reflected not the world around it, but the world as it could be. The girl would spend hours staring at the leaves, seeing versions of herself making different choices, living different lives.

One day she climbed the tree to pick a particular leaf that showed her as a great scholar. But when she touched it, she found herself standing in that reflected world, and a different version of herself was now in the tree, reaching for a leaf that showed her in a garden.

They traded places. Then traded again. And again.

Eventually neither could remember which reflection was original. Were there two girls, or thousands, all shifting between leaves? Was she the real one, or just another reflection reaching for a leaf that showed the real her?

Small dancing lights began to appear around her as she climbed, like confused fireflies following her from leaf to leaf. She couldn't tell if they were real or reflections, if they belonged to this world or one of the thousands shown in the leaves.

The tree still grows, they say. And sometimes people see a girl climbing through its branches, small lights trailing after her, searching for the leaf that shows her true self. But each time she thinks she's found it, she touches the leaf and finds herself somewhere else, reaching for another leaf, forever searching for a reality that might never have existed.

Some say the tree was a gift. Others say it was a test. A few claim it was a warning: not all truths can be found by looking at reflections. Some things, once lost to illusion, can never be recovered.

## The Forest of Singing Stones
In the old forest stands a grove where the stones sing. Not metaphorically... they actually produce sound, humming in harmonies that change with the seasons.

Travelers who camp there report strange dreams. Some dream of lives they never lived. Others dream of the same moment repeated a thousand different ways, each time making a different choice.

A scholar once spent a month in the grove, trying to understand the stones' song. He claimed he could hear words in the melody, though he couldn't quite make them out. On his final night, he suddenly understood.

"They're not singing," he told his companions when he returned. "They're remembering. The stones are so old they've absorbed echoes of everything that's happened near them. Every conversation. Every choice. Every life. They're playing it all back, all at once."

The sword... I tried to make it remember being sharper. Nine perfect cuts. On the tenth it shattered because the iron REMEMBERED being iron and rejected the false memory I gave it.

But what if I'm approaching this wrong? What if instead of fighting the memory... I EDIT the memory? Make the object remember being something else from the BEGINNING? Iron that remembers being gold. Stone that remembers being glass. Flesh that remembers being...

This could work. This MUST work.]

"Then what about the dreams?" his companions asked.

"The stones don't distinguish between what happened and what could have happened," he said. "When you sleep near them, they show you both. Past and possible futures, all tangled together."

He never returned to the grove. When asked why, he would only say: "Some stones remember too much. And they don't understand that humans aren't meant to hear it all."

## The Last Light
Before humans learned to make fire, they huddled in caves during the long dark. The nights were endless and terrible, filled with sounds they couldn't identify and dangers they couldn't see.

One night, a child wandered from the cave and didn't return. The tribe searched but found nothing. They assumed the dark had taken her.

Three days later, she came back carrying a small flame in her cupped hands. It didn't burn her. It didn't go out in the wind. It simply glowed, warm and steady.

"Where did you get that?" the elders asked.

"I was lost in the dark," she said. "Something found me. It asked if I was afraid. I said yes. It asked if I wanted to see. I said yes. It reached into itself and pulled out this piece of light and placed it in my hands. Then it left."

"What did it look like?" they asked.

"I don't know," she said. "It was darker than the dark around it. I only knew it was there because when it moved, the darkness moved differently."

The tribe used that flame to light all their fires. It never went out. Even when they divided it to spread to other tribes, each piece burned as bright as the original.

Some say that's why fire is sacred. Because it was a gift from something that lived in the dark and understood what it meant to be afraid.

Others say that's why we tend our fires so carefully. Because if we let them all die, we might have to go back into the dark and ask for another piece of light, and we're not certain the thing that gave it would be so generous twice.
