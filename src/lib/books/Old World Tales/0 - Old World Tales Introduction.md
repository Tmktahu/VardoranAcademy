# Old World Tales: Introduction
> **Series:** Old World Tales, Volume 0  
> **Collector:** Helena Grimward  
> **Written:** AD 58

In my travels across the regions surrounding Vardoran, I have collected stories from common folk. Tales told around fires, whispered in taverns, sung by wandering bards. These are the beliefs and fears and hopes of ordinary people, preserved before they fade from living memory.

Some colleagues question the value of such work. "Superstition," they call it. "Peasant nonsense." Perhaps they are right. But I believe folklore reveals truths about the cultures that create it, even if those truths are not literal.

I have organized these tales by the regions in which I collected them, preserving the voice and style of the storytellers as much as possible. Some are cautionary tales meant to teach children. Others explain natural phenomena or historical events through metaphor. Still others seem to serve no purpose but entertainment, though I suspect deeper meanings hide beneath the surface.

I make no claims about their veracity. I am merely a collector, preserving what might otherwise be lost.
