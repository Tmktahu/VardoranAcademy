## The Door That Opens Inward

A necromancer of considerable skill wanted to understand death itself, not merely puppet its remains. She arranged a hundred corpses in ancient patterns and called out not to spirits, but to whatever lay beyond the veil.

Something answered.

It appeared as a figure of such paleness that color seemed to drain from the air around it. Some who heard this tale later claimed it wore black spikes like a crown.

"You called," it said. "What do you want?"

"To master death," the necromancer replied.

"You puppet corpses. That is not mastery." The figure studied her. "But I can touch you. The dead will respond more readily. You will feel the boundary between life and death as something you can grasp. You will become quite powerful."

"What is the price?"

The figure smiled. "Raise more dead. Many more. Train others. Spread the practice until it becomes common. Every corpse you raise is a door held open. I simply wish to see how many doors you can hold at once."

The necromancer, confident she understood the bargain, accepted.

Her students claimed that in her final years, she would wake screaming about something waiting on the other side of all those doors. Something patient. Something that had been pulling while she thought she was pushing.
## Three Warnings for Children

**The Boy Who Forgot to Feel**

A boy boasted he feared no cold. He climbed the northern mountains in summer clothes. When he returned, he shivered despite the warm fire.

"I feel nothing," he insisted, even as he grew stiller each day.

His mother wept. "Cold is not about temperature. It is about knowing you can be hurt and choosing to endure anyway."

The boy turned to stone, they say, still insisting he felt nothing at all.

**The Plans That Never Built**

A girl filled notebooks with designs for wonderful machines. But she never built them.

"I must perfect them first," she said.

One night, lightning struck her house. In the morning, all her notebooks were blank. A single note remained: "Dreams without action vanish like smoke."

**The Saint Who Prayed Forever**

A priest loved prayer more than anything. He prayed so well that he forgot to eat. Forgot to sleep. Forgot he had a body at all.

His followers found him smiling before the altar, thin as paper, eyes bright with joy.

"Even goodness," they whispered, "can consume you if you forget to remain human."
## The Well of Voices

There is a well in the ruins of an old village. No one remembers the village's name or why it was abandoned, but the well remains, and people avoid it.

Those who look into it see no water. Just darkness. But if you listen, you hear voices.

At first, they sound like echoes... your own voice reflected back. But if you listen longer, the voices become different. Other people. Other conversations. Some from years ago. Some from yesterday. All tangled together in the dark below.

A curious scholar once lowered a rope into the well to measure its depth. The rope ran out at two hundred feet with no bottom reached. When he pulled it back up, the end was frayed, as if something had been chewing on it.

Another traveler, desperate for water, called down into the well: "Is there water?"

A hundred voices answered back, all at once, none saying the same thing. Some said yes. Some said no. Some said things that made no sense. But one voice, clearer than the rest, said: "There is water. But it remembers everyone who has ever drunk it. Do you want to remember them too?"

The traveler left without drinking.

They say the well doesn't just collect water. It collects moments. Every word spoken near it. Every thought thought near it. All of it sinks down into the dark and stays there, mixing together, until you can't tell where one voice ends and another begins.
## The Painter's Canvas

A painter became obsessed with creating the perfect portrait. Not of a person, but of beauty itself. The abstract ideal. The thing that makes all beautiful things beautiful.

She painted for years. Each attempt came close but never quite captured what she envisioned. She destroyed canvas after canvas, growing more desperate.

One night, exhausted, she fell asleep in her studio. She dreamed of a figure made entirely of color... not wearing colors, but made of them, constantly shifting.

"You cannot paint beauty itself," the figure said. "Beauty only exists in relation to something. It needs a face, a landscape, a moment. Without context, it's just color on canvas."

"Then what should I paint?" she asked.

"Paint what you love," it said. "Beauty will follow."

When she woke, she painted her elderly mother's face. Every wrinkle. Every spot. Every imperfection earned through a long life.

When she finished, she stepped back and wept. It was the most beautiful thing she had ever created.

Her students asked what changed. How she had finally achieved what she'd sought for so long.

"I stopped trying to paint beauty," she said, "and painted love instead. Beauty came on its own."

The painting hangs in a museum now. People stand before it for hours, though they can't quite explain why. Some say the woman in the portrait seems to change depending on who's looking at her... as if the painting shows each viewer what they personally find beautiful in human faces.

The painter never explained how she achieved that effect. She died peacefully years later, having never attempted another portrait. She spent the rest of her life painting simple things... fruits, flowers, everyday objects... and every one was somehow extraordinary.
