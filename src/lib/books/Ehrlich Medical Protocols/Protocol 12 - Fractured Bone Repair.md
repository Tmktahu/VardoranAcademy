# Protocol 12: Fractured Bone Repair – Comprehensive Treatment
> **Series:** Ehrlich Medical Protocols
> **Author:** Martin Ehrlich  
> **Written:** 205 AMR
## Purpose
To document the systematic approach for treating **complete or partial bone fractures** in extremities, with emphasis on **tibial and fibular breaks**. Protocol encompasses stabilization, blood-enhanced regeneration, and controlled healing progression to restore structural integrity and function.
## Materials Required
### Stabilization Materials
- Emery-infused splinting material or darksilver rods (for complex fractures)
- Coldpress Clotting Compound (Protocol 08)
- Cotton binding strips
- Bloodrose distillate for wound cleaning
### Blood Enhancement
- **Primary**: Brute + Warrior blood combination (see Blood Effects documentation)
- **Alternative**: Creature + Brute blood combination for severe trauma cases
- Glass droppers for precise application
- Sterile injection syringes for internal administration
### Additional Compounds
- Snow flower extract (for swelling reduction)
- Thermal Equilibrium Serum (Protocol 04) if temperature regulation needed
- Standard pain management supplies
## Assessment Protocol
### Initial Examination
1. Determine fracture type: complete, partial, compound, or comminuted
2. Assess surrounding soft tissue damage
3. Check for arterial involvement or nerve compression
4. Document patient's current blood condition and compatibility
### Fracture Classification
- **Simple**: Bone broken but skin intact
- **Compound**: Bone piercing skin surface
- **Comminuted**: Bone shattered into multiple fragments
- **Stress**: Hairline crack from repeated strain
## Treatment Protocol
### Stage 1: Stabilization (0-30 minutes)
1. **Immediate immobilization** of affected limb using available materials
2. **Control hemorrhaging** if compound fracture present
   - Apply Coldpress Compound to any open wounds
   - Clean wound bed with bloodrose distillate
3. **Pain management** using available anesthetic protocols
4. **Assess circulation** distal to fracture site
### Stage 2: Reduction and Alignment (30-60 minutes)
1. **Manual reduction** of displaced bone fragments
   - Apply steady traction to restore length
   - Align bone ends using palpation and visual confirmation
2. **Splint application** to maintain position
   - Secure above and below fracture site
   - Ensure adequate padding to prevent pressure sores
3. **Verification** of proper alignment through range of motion testing
### Stage 3: Blood Enhancement Application (60-90 minutes)
1. **Prepare blood mixture**:
   - **Brute + Warrior combination** for standard cases
     - Accelerated healing + enhanced bone density
     - Improved damage resistance during recovery
     - Enhanced muscle mass development around fracture
   - **Creature + Brute combination** for severe trauma
     - Natural healing + combat regeneration
     - Enhanced survival response + improved recovery time
2. **Application method**:
   - External: Apply 2-3 drops directly over fracture site
   - Internal: 0.1-0.2 mL injection near bone ends (compound fractures only)
   - Monitor for immediate healing response and side effects
3. **Dosage schedule**:
   - Initial application at time of treatment
   - Secondary application at 24-hour mark if healing insufficient
   - Tertiary application at 72 hours only if complications arise
## Post-Treatment Monitoring
### First 24 Hours
- Check circulation and sensation hourly
- Monitor for compartment syndrome development
- Assess splint integrity and positioning
- Document pain levels and mobility restrictions
### 24-72 Hours
- Evaluate initial bone healing progress
- Adjust splinting if swelling changes
- Secondary blood application if necessary
- Begin limited range of motion exercises
### 1-2 Weeks
- Progressive weight bearing as tolerated
- Splint removal and assessment of bone union
- Transition to rehabilitation protocols
- Final healing confirmation before full activity clearance
## Observed Complications
### Blood Enhancement Side Effects
#### Brute + Warrior Combination:
- Enhanced muscle density may cause temporary stiffness
- Improved bone strength during healing
- Increased appetite and protein requirements
- Temporary enhancement of grip strength in treated limb
#### Creature + Brute Combination:
- Accelerated healing may cause increased pain sensitivity
- Enhanced scar tissue formation
- Temporary muscle tension and restlessness
- Improved wound clotting throughout body
### Treatment Failures
- Inadequate reduction leading to malunion
- Infection in compound fractures despite treatment
- Compartment syndrome from excessive swelling
- Blood enhancement rejection in immunocompromised subjects
## Success Metrics
### Optimal Outcomes
- Fracture site shows visible healing within 48 hours
- Patient maintains full range of motion post-treatment
- No complications or secondary injuries
- Return to normal function within 2-3 weeks
### Acceptable Outcomes
- Fracture heals with minor deformity but full function
- Extended healing time but no permanent disability
- Minor complications managed successfully
- Patient satisfaction with pain management
## Notes for Further Study
- Investigate whether Perfect Gem integration could enhance bone regeneration
- Study long-term effects of repeated blood enhancement on bone density
- Explore use of Arcane Core energy to accelerate healing in complex fractures
- Test efficacy of Rejuvenation Juice (Construct 05) as adjunct therapy
