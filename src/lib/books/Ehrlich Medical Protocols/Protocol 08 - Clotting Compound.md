# Protocol 08: Coldpress Clotting Compound – Hemostasis Stabilizer
> **Series:** Ehrlich Medical Protocols
> **Author:** Martin Ehrlich  
> **Written:** 202 AMR
## Purpose
To document the formulation and efficacy of a compound designed to **halt external bleeding**, **induce clotting**, and **stabilize open wounds**. The agent uses _cotton fiber_ as a delivery matrix, _snow flower extract_ as a vasoconstrictive agent, and _bloodrose oil_ as a regenerative carrier. Resulting compound acts rapidly when pressed to a bleeding site, creating a semi-coagulated mesh that initiates scab formation.
## Materials
### Raw Cotton
- Cleaned and dried.
- Pulled into loose tufts.
- Absorbs fluid while applying mild pressure.
- Serves as both applicator and binding matrix.
- _Preferred fiber length: 15–25 mm._
### Snow Flower
- Fresh petals only.
- Crushed and cold-steeped in low-mineral water for 4–6 hours.
- Extract filtered and reduced to a chilled concentrate.
- _Potency window: 12 hours post-extraction._
### Bloodrose Distillate
- Acts as a carrier for the snow flower extract and stimulates skin closure.
- _Blend ratio: 2 parts Bloodrose Distillate to 1 part Snow Flower Extract._
### Preparation
1. Mix snow flower extract into bloodrose oil. Stir until uniform suspension is achieved.
2. Soak cotton tufts in the resulting mixture until saturated.
3. Store prepared tufts in sealed wax-paper wraps or glass jars.
4. Refrigeration not required. Discard after 3 days if unused.
## Application Protocol

### Surface Wound
1. Clean wound of debris and excess blood.
2. Apply soaked cotton tuft directly to bleeding site.
3. Press gently for **1–2 minutes**. Do not remove prematurely.
4. Once bleeding has slowed or stopped, secure in place with light wrap.
5. Replace every 12–24 hours as needed.
### Deep Bleeding
- Not effective for punctures or arterial wounds.
- May be used to slow bleeding until surgical closure is possible.
- Increase tuft thickness but maintain standard soak ratio.
## Test Results
### Self
- Reopened test scar along left forearm.
- Applied compound immediately post-cut.
- Rapid clotting observed. Minor discoloration.
- Wound healed cleanly. Scar remained.
### Patient A
- Eye forcefully removed.,
- Wound had not healed and continued to bleed for several weeks.,
- Bleeding stopped over the course of 2 weeks after treatment.
## Observed Behavior
- Snow flower sharply reduces blood flow in applied region.
- Bloodrose initiates soft tissue closure around forming clot.
- Cotton holds both pressure and moisture content, encouraging external scab.
- Mild cold sensation noted in all test subjects.
## Considerations
- Only for external use.
- Avoid overuse; excessive clotting may trap contaminants.
- Do not use on necrotic tissue.
- Do not re-soak used cotton; discard after application.
- Unused cotton tufts lose potency after 3 days.
## Notes for Further Study
- Test heat-treated variant to counter over-chilling in frost-sensitive patients.
- Explore replacing cotton with silk web for internal packing trials.
- Investigate if bloodrose carrier can support coagulants for internal bleeding.
- Check nerve response under compound exposure over extended durations (>6 hours).
