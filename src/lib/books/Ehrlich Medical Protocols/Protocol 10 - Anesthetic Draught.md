# Protocol 10: Trifold Anesthetic Draught: Induced Unconsciousness
> **Series:** Ehrlich Medical Protocols
> **Author:** Martin Ehrlich  
> **Written:** 203 AMR
## Purpose
To document the formulation and self-testing of an anesthetic draught composed of **Trippy Shroom**, **Snow Flower**, and **Mourning Lily**. Designed to **induce unconsciousness**, **numb pain**, and **suppress movement** during procedures. Can also be injected locally for targeted numbing.
## Materials

### Trippy Shroom
- Psychoactive; causes visual distortion, drowsiness, and disorientation.
- Harvested, dried, and powdered. Handle with care; avoid inhalation.
### Snow Flower
- Chilling herb from cold zones.
- Induces localized numbness and nerve dulling. Use fresh or gently dried.
### Mourning Lily
- Found in graveyards and magically attuned to death.
- Boiled for oils that deepen sedation and reduce reflexive response.
### Base Solution
- Neutral water or light alcohol base, gently heated.
- Optional acidic tincture may extend shelf life.
## Brewing Protocol
1. Add 1 part **Snow Flower**, 2 parts **Trippy Shroom** to vessel.
2. Add warm base liquid. Stir gently.
3. Add Mourning Lily extract dropwise.
4. Steep uncovered for 7 minutes.
5. Strain and bottle in light-blocking vial.
6. Store cool; use within 72 hours.
## Application Protocol
### Ingested
1. Ensure subject has eaten lightly.
2. Dose: **3-4 sips** (~30-40 mL).
3. Expect drowsiness in 3-5 minutes; unconsciousness by 8-10.
4. Maintain airway; proceed with procedure.
### Local Injection
1. Draw 0.5-1.0 mL into sterile syringe.
2. Inject near treatment site (subdermal).
3. Numbing onset in 30-90 seconds.
4. Reapply in new sites as needed (every 15 minutes).
5. Avoid vascular or spinal injection.
## Test Results
### Subject A (Zrott)
- Took 4 sips (~40 mL).
- Numbness in extremities, blurred vision, echoing sounds.
- Lost consciousness after ~8 minutes.
- Woke 35 minutes later, mildly disoriented.
- No memory of external stimuli.
## Observed Behavior
- Gradual onset allows preparation time.
- Subject enters deep, non-restful unconsciousness.
- Pulse and breath remain steady.
- Muscle slack observed.
- Local injection yields effective numbness without sedation.
## Risks & Side Effects
- High doses may prolong unconsciousness or cause dream-state linger.
- Nausea if fasted.
- Rare: tremors or sleep spasms.
- Repeated use may dull effectiveness or trigger hallucinations.
## Considerations
- Do not mix with alcohol, venom sap, or stimulants.
- Best used in monitored conditions.
- Discontinue if subject fails to wake after 45 minutes.
- For local use, avoid major arteries or spine.
## Notes for Further Study
- Test on weaker constitutions.
- Refine dosage for small patients.
- Explore resin-based or inhaled forms.
- Study effects on magical resistance.
- Evaluate stabilizer additives for smoother recovery.
