# Protocol 07: Emery/Bloodrose Suspension: Venom Sap Neutralization
> **Series:** Ehrlich Medical Protocols
> **Author:** Martin Ehrlich  
> **Written:** 201 AMR
## Purpose
To document the results and formulation method of a reactive compound used to excise **Venom Sap infection** from living tissue. The substance is formed by suspending powdered *unrefined emery ore* in a high-grade *bloodrose distillate*. This mixture induces acute localized trauma followed by immediate regenerative response. Process is violent, painful, and effective.
## Materials
### Emery Ore (unrefined)
- Ground to a coarse particulate.
- Irregular edges preferred.
- Reacts fully with venom sap compounds; dissolves during chemical reaction.
- *Ideal grain size: 0.05-0.2 mm.*
### Bloodrose Distillate
- Extracted from mature petals under low heat.
- Filtered and reduced to concentrate regenerative compounds.
- *Minimum potency: 80% active extract by volume.*
- Stabilized with 10% neutral spirit (for consistency and shelf life).
### Standard Mix Ratio (per 1 cm² wound site)
- Crushed Emery: **0.15 grams**
- Bloodrose Distillate: **1.0 mL**

Mixture may be prepared in advance and stored in sealed glass vials. Shake thoroughly before use. Sediment is expected but should disperse with agitation.
## Application Protocol
### Topical Use
1. Expose site. If wound is crusted or sealed, reopen it.
2. Confirm presence of active venom sap (site will appear slick with purple discharge, purple veins, can apply a small bit of emery particulate for confirmation).
3. Shake vial vigorously for 10+ seconds to resuspend emery.
4. Apply directly. Ensure full surface contact. Do not spread; let it pool and burn.
5. Wait **20-30 seconds**. Signs of reaction: bubbling, blackening, sharp odor, screaming.
6. Flush with pure bloodrose distillate. Bind wound loosely to allow for seepage.
### Intravenous Use
- Reserved for cases of systemic spread (e.g., bloodborne toxins or infection).
- Inject **slowly** into large vein using a **heavy-gauge needle**. Mixture is thick and causes deep burning sensation.
- Onset of reaction is rapid: expect fever, tremors, extreme pain, followed by accelerated recovery.
- Monitor heart rate and respiration closely. Sedation recommended but not always tolerated.
- Once reaction has subsided, flush with pure bloodrose distillate to expel remaining emery.
## Test Results
### Patient X
- Fresh wound, toxins still wet.
- Tissue purged. Pain tolerable.
- Recovered in about 2 weeks. No spread.
### Self
- Deliberate laceration; corruption left to incubate 16 hrs.
- Reaction was more volatile. Potential minor nerve damage. Visible scar.
- Longer recovery. Estimated 3 weeks.
- No residual corruption.
## Observed Behavior
- Emery reacts with corrupted substances and dissolves completely during the process, producing heat and dissolution of infected cells.
- Bloodrose encourages rapid cellular regeneration.
- Mixture ratio affects healing timing, which is critical: too early, and the sap survives; too late, and damage is permanent.
- Combined effect is akin to being burned by a flame and then healed simultaneously.
## Considerations
- Not selective. Healthy tissue will be damaged.
- Do not apply to uninfected wounds as the emery will not dissolve.
- Do not inject unless systemic infection is confirmed.
- Mixture must be shaken thoroughly before use; settled emery reduces efficacy.
- Use heat resistant gloves.
## Notes for Further Study
- Possible nerve thickening in healed sites; monitor for overgrowth or loss of sensation.
- Repeat exposure may dull pain response. Unclear if psychological or neurological.
- Intravenous applications should be mapped carefully; current dosage is empirical.
- Additional test subject required with deep tissue exposure (>1.5 cm). Volunteers unlikely.
