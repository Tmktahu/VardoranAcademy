# Protocol 11: Emery Saturation Cycle: Systemic Venom Sap Purge
> **Series:** Ehrlich Medical Protocols
> **Author:** Martin Ehrlich  
> **Written:** 204 AMR
## Purpose
To eliminate deep systemic **venom sap corruption** in cases where **reconstitution is incomplete or ineffective**. This method uses continuous blood circulation saturated with **micronized emery particulates** to burn out sap-infested tissue across the entire vascular system. It is **agonizing**, **invasive**, and **destructive**, but viable for vampires due to their regenerative capabilities.
## Materials
### Micronized Emery
- Pulverized to fine particulate, **ideal grain size: ≤ 10 μm**.
- Powder must be non-clumping and fully suspendable.
- Must fully dissolve upon reaction with venom sap.
- _NOTE: Overgrinding may reduce reactivity. Sift carefully._
### Blood Medium
- Preferably **fresh vampiric blood**, free of infection or corruption.
- May be pooled from thralls or donors.
- Blood type should be one the subject is familiar with.
- Minimum volume: **25 L** (standard adult vampire).
- Must remain oxygenated and heated (35-40°C).
### Suspension Mix Ratio
- Emery Powder: **0.1 g per 100 mL** blood
- Agitate continuously to maintain suspension
## Equipment
- Reinforced containment chamber (vat or sarcophagus)
- Circulatory system (pumps, filters, arterial taps)
- Pain suppressants (optional and may cause undocumented side effects)
- Monitoring: heart rate, clotting factors, neural activity
- Emergency silver restraints
## Application Protocol
### Step 1: Preparation
1. Secure subject on chair in device.
2. Install arterial and venous taps at primary junctions (femoral, jugular, subclavian preferred).
3. Prime pumping system with emery-blood solution.
### Step 2: Cycle Initiation
1. Begin **slow circulation** through subject’s body using the suspension.
2. Maintain **core temperature**, and monitor for signs of clotting or organ failure.
3. Increase saturation **gradually**: body-wide reaction onset expected within 3-6 hours.
4. Signs of reaction: burning sensations, blackened veins, extreme vocalization, involuntary spasms.
### Step 3: Sustained Purge
- Continue circulation for **3-5 days**, with periodic replenishment of fresh suspension.
- Cycle out mixture every 8-12 hours to avoid particulate depletion.
- Monitor for signs of **residual corruption pockets** (e.g., purple tinge, flaring pain, necrosis).
- If signs persist beyond Day 5, perform localized injection as per Protocol 07.
### Step 4: Termination and Flush
1. Cease suspension cycle.
2. Initiate **full flush** using **clean vampiric blood**.
3. Continue flush until no visible emery or reaction signs remain.
4. Final purge can be aided with a **forced reconstitution**, if available.
5. Subject should be monitored for **72 hours post-flush** for regression.
## Considerations
- **Do not use** on mortals or new vampires, as it is fatal within hours.
- Pain threshold limits may induce madness or frenzy.
- May cause **over-regeneration** (excess tissue growth, malformed vessels).
- Final flush is mandatory. Residual emery may cause **latent necrosis** or **calcification** in joints.
## Notes for Further Study
- Develop neutralizer compound for faster flush-out.
- Long-term cognitive effects unknown; follow-up required.
