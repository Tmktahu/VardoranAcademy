# Protocol 09: Controlled Vampiric Blood Application – Regenerative Aid
> **Series:** Ehrlich Medical Protocols
> **Author:** Martin Ehrlich  
> **Written:** 203 AMR
## Purpose
To document the controlled use of **vampiric blood** as a regenerative agent for treating **moderate to severe wounds** in living subjects. This protocol aims to harness the blood’s innate magic to **accelerate healing** without triggering unwanted conversion or immune system strain.
## Materials
### Vampiric Blood Sample
- Sourced from donor or pre-drawn, stabilized sample.
- Stored in sealed, light-blocking vials with silver-threaded stoppers to prevent magical degradation.
- Storage life: up to 7 days if kept cool and shielded from arcane interference.
- Discard immediately if sample darkens, thickens, or develops a sour-metallic odor.
### Application Tools
- Fine-tipped glass dropper.
- Sterilized injection syringe (for internal applications only).
- Saline or bloodrose rinse (to clean wound pre-application).
## Application Protocol

### External Wound
1. Clean wound of dirt, dead tissue, and excess blood using saline or bloodrose rinse.
2. Apply **one drop** of vampiric blood directly to exposed wound tissue.
3. Wait **30–60 seconds** for full absorption and visible magical reaction.
4. Reapply one drop at a time **only if tissue remains open or necrotic**.
5. Discontinue vampiric blood once wound has closed to minor laceration state.
6. Switch to standard treatments (e.g., Coldpress Compound, Bloodrise Distillate) for final healing.
### Internal Wound
1. Confirm location of injury via symptoms or observation.
2. Prepare **microdose** injection (~0.05–0.1 mL) of vampiric blood.
3. Inject directly into or near wound site.
4. Monitor subject for pain response and signs of systemic strain.
5. Limit use to **one injection per site** every 6 hours.
## Test Results
### Subject A
- Presented with extensive necrotic tissue and chaos-induced burns.
- Damaged tissue was excised prior to treatment. Three drops of vampiric blood applied directly to exposed wound bed.
- Tissue regeneration occurred rapidly. Wound closed sufficiently to permit application of Coldpress Compound and secure bandaging within 10 minutes.
- Subject reported intense pain but remained conscious throughout.
### Subject B
- Complete traumatic amputation at the shoulder; joint structure intact.
- Four drops applied to the exposed stump.
- No osseous regeneration observed; however, dermal and muscular tissues reformed over remaining structure.
- Subject experienced acute pain response with rapid breathing and involuntary thrashing.
- Wound sealed within 10 minutes. Coldpress Compound applied to stabilize surface.
- No further hemorrhaging noted post-treatment.
## Observed Behavior
- Healing process is **rapid but painful**, described by all subjects as “a thousand needles under the skin.”
- Regenerative effect **ceases when no wound remains**. Any excess blood may begin attempting conversion.
- Internal use carries **greater risk of systemic strain** if overdosed.
## Conversion Risk Symptoms
- Sudden chills or fever spike.
- Visual hallucinations or sensory dissonance.
- Localized bone pain (notably in femurs and sternum).
- Temporary blood pressure instability.
- Irritability, confusion, or compulsive hunger.
## Considerations
- Never apply to healthy subjects.
- Always apply blood in **minimal amounts**, just enough to trigger regenerative effect.
- Discontinue immediately if healing stalls or conversion symptoms arise.
- Blood loses potency rapidly; avoid storing post-use residue.
- Avoid use on subjects with immune deficiencies without additional monitoring.
## Notes for Further Study
- Investigate whether a magical “guiding agent” could enable controlled regeneration of complex tissue (e.g., limbs).
- Study immune markers in post-treatment blood to better understand minor conversion response.
- Explore slow-release bandage using stabilized vampiric blood for battlefield triage scenarios.
- Test dilution ratios to reduce conversion risk for delicate patients.
