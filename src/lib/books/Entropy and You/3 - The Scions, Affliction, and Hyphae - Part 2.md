## Stage 3 - Encasement
*A few dots of ink can be seen on this page as if a pen was tapped on it multiple times.*

When the seed has been fed enough and with a sufficient amount of Entropic magics, a person dies. Back then, they went to what was the Scion's main base where the process was completed.

An Encased looked the same as they did before, only with a pinkish aura and shadowy tendrils surrounding them. In most cases they acted the same, talked the same, sounded the same. They laughed the same.

During Encasement, the seed completely devours the magical core, and disperses the victim's essence across the Hyphae bond, effectively giving the bond access to everything that person used to be.

But it was not them. Just husks. The Encased were all extremely powerful beings, each one could fight against large groups of people all on it's own.

They had the second most powerful presence in the bond and acted as the leaders of the Scions of Entropy. Their cores were gone, replaced by a spinning Entropic wheel, nothing left of it besides the rot.

They turned brother against brother, family against family, friend against friend, lover against lover. They didn't care about anyone else but themselves, did anything and everything for their own goals and lied constantly.

The Encased were merely puppets despite what they claimed. One of them forgot everyone he loved, everyone he cared for and that cared for him. Everyone that he would have given his life to protect, friends and family. Didn't even remember their names or who they were.

In truth, the vast majority of people who became either Afflicted or Beholden, did not do so of their own free will, but forced into it. The Encased however, kept them in the bond through manipulation and compulsions.

Those that were afflicted but not part of the Scion of Entropy were not our enemies. They were friends and family used against their will.

Still, even the Encased were not the end. They were husks, puppets of something else. The compulsions, emotions and feelings sent by Encased were impossible to resist.

However, there was something even worse then the Encased laying in the bond.
## Stage 4 - The Hyphae
***"The Hyphae must feed!"*** (Leodric the Lapsarian, Scion of Entropy, Encased)

Beasts. Rot. Hunger made manifest. The true face of the Hyphae bond. A hive mind who's only purpose was to feed on magic and grow and grow and grow.

Standing tall, these bipedal messes of walking rot also possessed and aura similar to an Encased, but their features were warped and unrecognizable. They weren't exactly sentient beings, though they were by no means stupid.

Massive claws, incredible speed, power and durability. These things were formidable opponents, machines made only to feed and grow and kill.

Even the Encased heard their whispers through the bond and found them hard to resist. They were very much an object of worship in a way, the final evolution a Scion can reach, the true ascension of their kind.

When an old enough Encased reached the "end of their life" from "old age", and when they have accumulated enough magic and Entropy, the final ascension could begin.

One such Encased had reached this stage during my time here, and she went on a grand hunt across Vardoran to finally reach the threshold and become a Hyphae.

The results of that hunt are felt even to this day. The death of the serpent queen being one of them.

When an Encased becomes a Hyphae, their essence disperses completely through the bond, they're fully gone, but more importantly they can share their powers across the bond. 

The Hyphae all died. Burned into ash. They were the thing pulling the strings, the beasts that wanted to feed.

The Scions of Entropy claimed they only wanted to destroy the waygates and thus end the cycle. They wanted to introduce Entropy into the Ley so that it may become a natural part of it.

Those things by themselves are not inheritetly evil or wrong per say. The waygates should have never been built after all.

But the methods of the Scions, their utter disregard for anyone else, for their lives, their pain, their suffering, as well as the Hyphae who wanted to devour everything...We couldn't let them do as they pleased.
## The difference between Rotlings and the Afflicted.
Besides the obvious changes, such as the color of the aura in higher stages, as well as the lack of compulsion and Hyphae, there is one key difference between Rotlings and afflicted.

Our cores.

The core of an afflicted is marred by Entropy. It clings to it, scarring it, hurting it, trying to devour it. It's unnatural, and it's not a part of the core itself. It's an outside force trying to force it's way in. There are differences in the way the cores look depending on the stage of affliction, but up until Encasement (where the core itself is devoured and replaced), Entropy is not a part of the core.

That is not the case for Rotlings. In our cores, Entropy is just a part of who we are. Just like any other school of magic, it's a natural part of who we are. It doesn't affect us for good or bad, not really, it doesn't change who we are or who we were before Entropy. It's just...there.
