## The Record of War
The Scions of Entropy sought to use powerful artefacts gathered from the empowered beings of this land to destroy the waygates. In addition, they staged attacks on a few waygates using the Hyphae, destroying them in the process. The one in Dunley for example, above the monastery, was destroyed by a Hyphae. In addition, certain locations in Vardoran, such as Maja's tower, are something called Ley points. Places where the Ley was closer to the surface. By attacking and killing the beings attached to these places, the Scions filled those beings' connection to the Ley with Entropy and thus opened more and more wounds in the Ley, spreading Entropy throughout the land.

Back then the rot carried on the air. Whenever you went outside, wherever you went, you could smell it.

At some point, we realized that beating them in a fight is not the right approach to the situation. They were stronger, better organized and used our own friends and families against us.

We chose a different approach. Rather than try and fight them directly, we decided to fix the damage they were doing. Through rituals, we closed wounds in the Ley and cleaned it from Entropy. These rituals were simple in concept most of the time. Use magical resources attuned to the place. For example, storm magic in Adam's mansion over at North Gloomrot, Necromancy for the iron mines, so on and so on.

With each one of these rituals, things changed for the better. The air became cleaner, the Ley began to slowly flow anew, the wounds in it closed one by one.

In addition, we also used the "Whirlpool ritual" to cleanse people of Entropy and cure them of the affliction. Many of you might have seen an improved version of this ritual and not too long ago. The cult of decay found the old blueprints and documentation for said ritual, added more safety measures and increased the scale.

In essence, this ritual unwind the Entropy that clung to a person's core as a result of the affliction, broke it apart into it's components (the different schools of magic), and stored the magic safely in containers.

This same ritual can be done in larger scale, just like it was done in the cemetery and in Maja's tower not long ago.

I wish to make something very clear when it comes to the whirlpool rituals.

Not all of them were done with the agreement of the afflicted or Beholden individual. Sometimes we had to trap, drug and kidnap people to get them into the ritual room, bind them in chains to stop them from escaping.

One of the compulsions made by the Encased was to resist the ritual. The bond felt so warm, so kind, so caring and loving. It took advantage of people's weaknesses, whispered promises and lies.

We had to burn some of our own.

Am I proud of these actions? No. I would never be. Some of the things we've done have no place for forgiveness. Do I regret them? No.

We were in a war. We did what we had to in order to survive. We were driven by fear and paranoia, many of us treated it as something personal, allowed emotions to guide us instead of reason. I myself was no different in that regard on multiple occasions.

We launched a duel assault on the Scions' bases. One acted as both a distraction, and an attack force on the Hyphae nest in western crypts of Farbane. The other group used the distraction to strike at the Oasis in the Eastern crypts.

I was on the team attacking the Oasis. We caught them off guard and while the forces of the Scions went to aid the Hyphae in their nest, they left only Talchar to defend the Oasis. 

In a previous battle, the Hyphae demonstrated the ability to use the voice of those that died while part of the affliction bond. They used their voices, their manners, way of speaking. They used the voices of the people we loved against us.

Down there in the Oasis, we found more than just Talchar. We found the echoes stolen by the Hyphae. We fought against them. Killed them. I was forced to once more witness the death of the person I considered closer than a sister to me. Watch what was left of her, what the affliction stole from her, burn to nothing.

We cleansed the Oasis from Entropy, freed it's protector and took the Scions' main base of operations from them. The Encased could not exist outside of the Oasis for prolonged periods of time since they needed the Entropy down there like humans need air. By taking that from them, it was only a matter of time.
# The final ritual
This was it. After so many losses, after so many sacrifices, we finally had them on the back foot. After years of fighting a losing battle, the end was in sight.

We had a choice. A power source was discovered. Something primal, ancient, something that is not of this world, something that came from the stars. We could have used it as a weapon. Annihilate Entropy and the Scions, erase any mention of them from the world.

Or, we could have used this weapon for the Ley. To cleanse it, to get rid of the masses of Entropy that were clogging it. We chose to heal rather than destroy. As a result of this choice, Entropy continued to exist, but... differently. Rotlings are the prime example of this.

Was it the right choice? Was it even our choice to make?

Maybe. Maybe not. Only time will tell.

One final time, Vardoran prepared for battle.

*This next part is heavily scratched out, completely unreasonable.*
## Concluding statements
I tried to be as unbiased as possible, but as someone who fought in the thick of this war, as someone who suffered loss from this war, that is impossible.

I hear the words "War heros" thrown around by people who were not there. We aren't heroes. There are no heroes in a war. We've all done things we're not proud of, things that do not deserve to be called heroic by any sense of the word.

Shoving a bottle of liquid fire down someone's throat is not heroic.

We did what we felt we had to. We did things out of fear and confusion, out of need to survive. We did things to protect our loved ones, our friends and families.

Just as the Scions of Entropy did. Or at least some of them. I've seen things from their eyes, and I mean this literally. I saw their suffering, felt their fear, felt their care for eachother. It was too late of course, and by the time we fought them, they were nothing but husks of the Hyphae, but...

But the point I'm badly trying to make is, there are no heros in war, only people wanting to survive.

Rotlings are not Scions. We are not afflicted or Beholden or Encased. Those can no longer exist. Compulsions can't be sent through the rotling bond. The Hyphae are dead.

Entropy is just... another part of the cycle now.

I wrote all of this for a few reasons. To share information, to clear up fears and confusion. More importantly, I don't want anyone to repeat the mistakes of the past. All of this knowledge was gained at too high of a cost. Too many losses and sacrifices. We feared the unknown and lost what we had.

This war is meaningless. You have time, you have each other. Don't let these squabbles take people from you. Be there for those you love and love you. Before it's too late. Before they're gone. Before any more innocents are caught in the middle.

I don't want to see more busts in the memorial.
