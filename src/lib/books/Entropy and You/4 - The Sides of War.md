## The War
I will be the first to admit, I found this section, which I don't doubt most of you would find the most important or interesting, the hardest part write.

It's easy to write about magical phenomena, especially one that is gone and over with like the affliction. Easy to distance yourself from it when you know that you yourself had a hand in burning it all away.

But war? War is present no matter when or where you are. Even from my room I can hear the roars of battle all the way from Mortium, feel the ground shaking beneath the feet of warriors.

The last choice of the last age was a choice between destruction and healing. Both choices would have had consequences, good and bad.

I will hope that in this war, the same choice we made will be chosen, as I still stand by it.

The Ley is all that matters.
## The fighting sides
On the one hand, we had the Scions of Entropy. A doomsday cult, mostly made up of afflicted individuals, at least the sect in Vardoran.

Here are it's known members:
### Afflicted
None
### Beholden
#### Red reclaimer
A former knight from a dying kingdom, wielding a great sword and axes, preferred mounted combat. Dead.
#### Talchar
A former paladin of Luminence, died in combat and was taken in by the Scions. Wielded holy magic in combat. Possibly had a seed. Dead.
#### Bloodmoonhunter
A seeker of worthy combat, wielded a great sword. Dead.
#### Bradford
Dead
#### The Crow
A spy master, skittering around, loved gifts and shiny things, not a good fighter. Able to fly, some sort of beast man hybrid. Alive. More then likely no longer Beholden, but a normal rotling.
### Encased
#### The first Judge
One of the oldest members of the Scions of Entropy we came across. Powerful, calculating, ruthless. Apparently had a sense of humour. Wielded a Reaper stolen from the Keeper of the Oasis, mastery of Necromancy, could pass through walls and bypass castle magics. The Judge fed her seed sunlight and fire, and thus was able to walk in the day. Attempted to ascend into a Hyphae, permanently killed Megara in her attempt. She succeeded, partly, as while she did become a Hyphae, it was too hurt and injured, went into a coma of sorts and couldn't fully spread it's fire and sun resistance through the Hyphae bond. Dead.
#### The second Judge
Dead. *something is scratched out here.* Picked up the Judge's Reaper after her death and took up the mantle. Expert necromancer and fighter, supernaturally fast, used poison darts. Staked in the heart by Callan the bloodstained using a holy stake. Dead. ~~Should have just left him alone. He just wanted to keep his family safe.~~
#### The executioner
Expert fighter and frost magic user, preferred the twinblades. Burned to death in the hollowed mountains. ~~Another one we lost.~~
#### Palidius
Another necromancer, used a spear mostly. Dead.
#### The Moriggan
A fortune teller, preferred to play with her victims using bone dice. Was trialed and burned as a witch in her life before being rescued by the first Judge. A devote follower of the Scions and believer in their cause. A powerful chaos magic user, but her magic was more wild than disciplined, power over control. ~~She just wanted to live.~~
#### Leodric the Lapsarian
One I mentioned earlier, a hedonistic man above all, did not truly care about the anything but his own amusement and way of life. Worshipped the rot and the Hyphae. Acted like he knew a lot more than he actually did. Was able to surround himself with a hardened form of radiant fiber to create a golem which was his main way of fighting. Also used chaos magic, but while the Moriggan preferred pure power over control, Leodric wanted to put on a show. Big explosion, large area of effect. Nothing of substance. Was crushed to a pile of goop by a massive empowered war golem. ~~Still upset I missed that.~~
#### Orelio the stagnant
Illusions and a little bit of Necromancy, used slashers. Insane, high on every drug there is most of the time, was close with Leodric. Wanted the whole world to sink into rot and stagnation. Was placed inside of an iron maiden with silver stakes inside and runes prevention reconstitution anywhere but inside the iron maiden. Said iron maiden was then thrown into the sea. Dead.
#### Catharsis
Used a Reaper and necromancy, was able to split herself into multiples, had a massive mouth open in the middle of her body and tentacles came out of it. The most dangerous part about her however, was her ability to devour the memories of those she eats. In most cases, the memories returned given time and assistance from others, but not all of them. Dead.
#### The Hunger
Makes Entropic "food" out of sludge and radiant fibers. Dead.
#### The Hyphae
The last stage of Affliction as talked about earlier in this journal. All dead. All burned to piles of ash, across the world. I felt it all. Every single one of them burning. Dead
