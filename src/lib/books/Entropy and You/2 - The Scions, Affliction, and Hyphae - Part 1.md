## The Scions of Entropy, the Affliction and the Hyphae
Now then. I'll start by saying that we do not know how the Scions of Entropy were formed. We don't know who was "the first" or who brought them all together. We know who was one of the oldest members, but we will get to that at a later point.

To understand what the members of the Scions of Entropy were, I will explain the different stages of the affliction as it was called back then.

These stages are the result and manifestation of vast amounts of Entropy in a person's magical core. These stages could exist in a person regardless of age, gender or species, though those that do not have a form of immortality would find...trouble at any stage beyond the first one.

*It is important to understand that in this point in time, in this age, these stages no longer truly exist. There are rotlings, Entropic humans, and one more thing which I'll get to later.*
## Stage 0 - "Enchanted" humans
Enchanted humans, or those that are now known as Entropic humans, are a more dormant form of rotlings. They do not display any visible signs of Entropy, they do not have access to the Entropic bond and for all intents and purposes they are simply humans. 

The difference lay in their magical core. An Entropic human's core has a small thread of Entropic in it. This small thread is what allows Entropic humans to cast magic, even if in a more limited capacity.
## Stage 1 - Afflicted
This stage is visibly identifiable by the purple aura that surrounds the subject, just like the one Rotlings posses in this age. At this stage, the afflicted would start feeling comradery and kinship with other afflicted, even people they hated before or have just met for the first time. They will be unnaturally protective of each other and care for each other.

In addition, at this stage the afflicted would gain access to what is now known as the "Rotling bond." However, I wish to make something very clear.

The Entropic/Rotling bond of this age, and the bond of 200 years ago, are completely different.

Those in the bond could send and receive emotions and feelings, just like the bond today. This however, is where the similarities end.

The affliction bond, or the Hyphae bond, constantly bombard those that were in it, whether they wanted or not, with feelings of love and care and warmth. Feelings of belonging, of finally coming home.

Hidden behind these feelings however, and sometimes popping out, were the true feelings of the originators of the bond. Hunger. Endless hunger, urge to devour anything and everything.
## Stage 2 - Beholden
This stage onwards is no longer possible. It can't exist in a world with magic being in it's current state.

This stage is when things truly begin to be dangerous. The subject is surrounded by a green aura and their position in the affliction hierarchy goes up. Stage 1 afflicted would feel automatic respect towards Beholden, no matter what their prior relationship was. Beholden were able to send more then just feelings through the bond, but also images and flashes of visions.

The truly dangerous and most dreadful part, was the compulsions. Those that have reached the stage of Beholden, could send powerful compulsions to other Beholden and to afflicted. These ranged from a dreaded fear of fire, to a kill on sight order to anything else. Beholden had an easier time resisting orders from other Beholden, while simple afflicted had a harder time.

The higher you were in the stages, the easier it was to resist the compulsions, and the harder it was to leave the bond.

In addition, this stage is where those complications for humans come in. Your blood would turn black as your body began to rot from within, your organs collapsing. We estimated a two day survival period for humans starting from becoming Beholden. Even vampires didn't get off easily after being cured, with some reporting of lasting damages to their bodies.
## Stage 2.5 - Seeded
In order to "ascend" from afflicted to Beholden as the Scions put it, one simply had to gather enough Entropy in their cores.  

The "ascension" from Beholden to Encased which is the name of the third stage, is not such a simple matter.

A few selected Beholden were given something known as a seed. I say given, but many either had it forcefully shoved down their throats or were under compulsions to accept the seed. This stage is...unique.

The aspiring Beholden was incredibly weak, unable to use most of their vampiric abilities such as transformations, summon their horses, or even move properly.

They all felt incredible hunger, but for different things. The seed was Somewhat sentient, each one had it's own personality and preferences, it's own wants and desires, many times mirroring those of the people they resides in.

The seed took a sit inside of the person's magical core.

Now, the seeds could feed on anything. One of the Encased fed her seed fire and sunlight and thus was able to walk in the sun. Another tried to feed it lightning, another grass fiber imbued with Entropy. Others fed it people.

Some fed it their own magic threads, leaving them unable to cast certain schools of magic.

Others fed it their own vampiric essence and pieces of their core. 

The seed was never satisfied, always hungry for more.

During this stage, a person's magical core would slowly start being replaced by a spinning wheel of Entropy.

This is the last stop. The last time a person can be cured. The last chance before there's no going back. The last chance before complete ego death.
