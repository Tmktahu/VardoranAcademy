## What is Entropy?
Rot, decay, stagnation, Ethereal magic. All of those are names given to Entropy, attempts at classifying it. In truth, those aren't particularly wrong, but it's actually a lot simpler.

Entropy is magic, simple as that.

If you were to take the schools of magic* and combine then together, you would in fact, find Entropy. 

At the beginning of every spell one casts, there's Entropy. A brief moment, unnoticeable, just before the magic breaks down into it's different schools and into the one that being casted.

At the end of every spell cast, there's Entropy. 

Entropy is the beginning and end of magic. The starting point and the finish line. It has always been here, always been a natural thing, but in small quantities that quickly vanished.
## Entropy in you, me and the Ley
Now you might be asking me, "But Emilia, you said that Entropy is a natural thing only in small quantities!" And you would be right to ask this of me dear reader but fret not, I will explain all in due time.

**The cycle**

I will try my best to keep this document as relevant to the event of two hundred years ago as I possibly can however, to understand the present and prepare for the future, we must look to the past.

Magic, just like life, moves in circle. A cycle, ever repeating, old and slow. It can take thousands of years or more for a cycle to be completed and begin anew. 

During this cycle, magic grows and the Ley flourish. Magic beyond what is possible in this day and age was common place at the cycle's peak. Realm walking, soul magic, flying cities.

The state of the world two hundred years ago however, was stuck at the lowest point of the cycle. The Ley dried up, arcane sigils broke, wards that held for years torn apart, the land shook and moved. The flying cities crashed down. I've seen that with my own eyes.

The cycle as we know it should have ended one thousand years ago and from it's end, a new era of magic would be born, just like what happened two hundred years ago.

The whole world lost it's magic, the veins of magic were dry as a desert everywhere.

Except for one place.

Except for Vardoran.

**Dracula and the waygates.**

To explain how Entropy became what it is today,  we have to go back to the past, about a millennium or so at this point in time. 

I will not be delving into the history of Noctum and Dracula himself, as while those are a fascinating subjects on their own right, we are only interested in one part of them, the waygates.

The waygates are constructs of Dracula that served as a transportation system across the land. This however, was just an added bonus compared to their true purpose.

The Ley, the natural lines of magic, rivers of pure mana, the breath and blood and veins of the world, flow deep beneath the surface. At the cycle's end, they were drying up. Dracula did not like that, not one bit.

How could he continue his war and conquest without magic? He made a plan, creating the waygates in order to pull the Leylines to Vardoran and closer to the surface.

During the last age, the Ley was so close you could almost touch it, and I mean that very literally. Something that was supposed to be out of the reach of men, something natural and beautiful, something that is necessary and needed and wanted, was grasped by the hand of one power hungry man.

This one selfish action caused unfathomable damage to the world and the cycle. I will say again, the cycle should have ended back then and start again. Instead it was stuck tethering on the edge of death, dying but unable to go over the line.

Thankfully, Dracula is dead. For good. No matter what it attempted, there's nothing left of him, his essence scattered to the winds.
