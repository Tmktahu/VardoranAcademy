## The Catastrophe and This Pen

The Academy collapsed and I've been trapped in the Astrological Department ever since. It's been a few years since everything came down. The walls buckled, the roof collapsed, corridors sealed themselves completely. I figured they'd have rescued me by now, but I suppose something about the collapse has made it difficult to reach me. The Board must be working on it, or at least I hope they are because I've been stuck here quite a while and I really need them to get on it.

Asmodeus always used to tell me I needed to document my observations properly. Record everything before leaving each evening, that sort of thing. I never bothered. I always had time later, or so I thought. Then the catastrophe happened and now I have nothing but time on my hands. So I suppose I might as well start documenting.

I rigged this enchanted pen about three weeks ago from whatever crystalline components and observation instruments I could salvage. It transcribes whatever I say into text, and I've finally got it working the way I want it to. So here we are. The first volume. I suppose Asmodeus would have wanted this eventually.

## Theralen

The sun everyone sees is not what Academy charts claim. They say it's a burning star generating its own heat and light through combustion, which is wrong. Theralen is a phenomenon not an object. Light flows toward Theralen from everywhere throughout reality and then disperses outward. Theralen is the focal point where all illumination energy concentrates, not the source of it.

What I have been tracking for a while now is Theralen's position relative to the Crown. It creates the convergence patterns that the Academy never properly measured. They assume sunspots are just random disturbances but I can predict them because they correspond to Theralen's position relative to certain celestial alignments.

## Crown of Weeping Suns

The Crown contains exactly forty-three stars. Academy charts identify twelve and label the rest as background. They're wrong about that. Observe the Crown mid-summer and you can clearly see all forty-three forming the crown geometry. The faint ones complete the pattern.

Theralen sits at the Crown center. This reveals something about Holy magic. It exists at all convergences simultaneously. The way I see it, when practitioners work with Holy magic they are not actually creating illumination. The illumination was already there and their practice aligns their perception with what already exists. The relationship is that Theralen illuminates what the pattern already contains.

## The Solar Lens

Theralen is the largest lens in existence. What we perceive as heat is the sensation of experiencing truth too intensely. Truth burns when experienced without preparation. If someone concentrated an entire sun's truth into one person they'd reach Quintessence convergence point and their pattern would absorb illumination reality entirely and shatter. This is why pure illumination must be approached gradually.

My calculations show the intensity at approximately fourteen-seven units per observation radius. The Academy dismisses this as "metaphorical" but Asmodeus always called the numbers "arbitrary precision."

## The Focal Distance

Our world sits at a very specific distance from Theralen. Academy astronomy claims this resulted from natural planetary formation. Just random chance. My calculations show this is not accidental at all. We exist at Theralen's precise focal point where the lens effect reveals illumination most effectively.

I measured illumination at different distances from Theralen and the readings don't follow what Academy theory predicts. The readings I got show illumination remains nearly constant when Theralen is within lens range, which makes perfect sense if Theralen operates as a lens rather than a light source. The lens reveals illumination that exists everywhere independent of distance.

The implication being that someone placed our world at Theralen's focal point intentionally. We exist where illumination reveals most clearly because conscious life needed to perceive truth most effectively.

Academy cosmologists dismissed this as nonsense but I have the measurements.

There. Volume One complete. The pen worked. Theralen documented. Asmodeus if you ever read this you can write me a formal apology.

Volume written AD 223 during 23 years of isolation. First Celestial Symbolica volume establishing enchanted pen documentation system. Early-period voice: coherent academic tone with occasional tangents, confident in measurements, references to Asmodeus and Academy dismissals, excited about proving theories correct. ~750 words.
