## Welcome to Practical Alchemy
You're holding the introduction to my field alchemy documentation. I started writing these guides because too many students kept asking the same questions, and frankly, I got tired of repeating myself. Now you get to benefit from my laziness.

This series covers field alchemy—formulations you can prepare with waterskin, basic ingredients, and minimal equipment. If you can grind plants and measure liquids, you can make everything in here. Notice I didn't say "safely make everything." That comes with practice and paying attention.

I've organized these seven formulations by what you're most likely to need first. Resistance brews because vampires face various threats regularly. Combat enhancement because you'll want to hit harder or cast better. Healing because you'll eventually hurt yourself doing stupid things. Trust me on that last one.
## What You'll Learn
This series teaches foundational technique applicable to all later work. How to grind plants properly. Why steeping time matters. Which ingredients need separation until mixing. The basics that prevent explosions, poisoning, or creating useless colored water.

Each formula includes source attribution. Some come from my own research through extensive trial and error—you'll notice I document failures enthusiastically. Others come from collaborations with colleagues or external sources. The Ashen Keep monster hunters, for instance, taught me their field-tested combat formulas. I've noted who contributed what because credit matters, and because knowing a formula's origin often explains its quirks.
## My Teaching Philosophy
I believe in learning through doing, with appropriate safety margins. Read the entire formula before starting. Gather all materials first. Then proceed carefully while accepting that mistakes happen. You'll waste materials. You'll create batches that don't work. This is normal and expected.

What's not acceptable is repeating the same mistake without learning why it failed. When something goes wrong, figure out what happened before trying again. My documentation includes development notes specifically so you can learn from my errors rather than making identical ones yourself.

Also: clean your workspace between preparations. I learned this the hard way when hell's clarion residue contaminated a blood rose batch, creating something that made test subjects smell like rotting fish for three days. The smell eventually faded. The embarrassment did not.
## Equipment You'll Need
Basic field alchemy requires minimal investment:

**Grinding Equipment:** Mortar and pestle, preferably stone. Wood absorbs compounds and creates contamination issues. Metal can react with certain plants. Stone is inert and easy to clean.

**Containers:** Multiple waterskins in good condition. Check for leaks before use. Label them clearly because drinking fire resistance brew when you meant to grab water creates unpleasant burning sensations.

**Measuring Tools:** Consistent measurement matters more than precision. If your "measure" is a particular cup or scoop, use that same tool every time. Switching between different measures ruins ratio consistency.

**Straining Material:** Clean cloth for removing solid particles. Some formulas work fine with sediment. Others become unstable if particulates remain suspended.

**Workspace:** Well-ventilated area away from open flames. Even water-based preparations can create flammable vapors during certain processes. Learn this from my documentation rather than personal experience.
## Safety Considerations (Read These, Seriously)
I know, safety sections are boring. Read them anyway because medical treatment for alchemical accidents is expensive and painful.

**Test Small First:** When preparing any formula for the first time, make a partial batch. If something goes wrong, you've wasted less material and created smaller disaster.

**No Improvisation:** These formulas use specific quantities for reasons. "Close enough" creates unpredictable results. Follow the ratios precisely until you understand why they work.

**Know Your Ingredients:** Some plants in these formulas are toxic if consumed incorrectly or in wrong concentrations. Don't taste raw materials. Don't test preparations on yourself without understanding expected effects.

**Work Sober:** Alcohol and alchemy don't mix. Save the drinking for after successful preparation, not during. I've seen too many preventable accidents from impaired judgment.

**Respect Time Requirements:** Steeping times aren't suggestions. Insufficient steeping produces weak effects. Excessive steeping can break down compounds or create unexpected reactions.
## How to Use This Series
Each formula follows consistent structure:

**Discovery Story:** Context about how this formula originated or what problem it solves. Helps you understand when to use it.

**The Formula:** Precise ingredients, measurements, and preparation steps. Follow these exactly until you've made successful batches.

**Practical Uses:** Real applications and scenarios where this formula proves valuable. Helps you decide which formulations to prioritize learning.

**Development Notes:** My failures, testing discoveries, and things I wish I'd known earlier. Learn from my expensive mistakes.

**Important Warnings:** Safety considerations and common errors. Usually placed last because that's when I remember them.

Read completely before starting preparation. Cross-reference plant descriptions in Flora Vardorana if uncertain about identification. Gather all materials before beginning. Prepare in order presented—early formulas teach techniques needed for later ones.
## A Note on Progression
Master these seven formulations before advancing to my Advanced Preparations series. The techniques you develop preparing field brews—proper grinding, timing awareness, ratio precision—form foundation for more complex work.

Don't rush advancement. Glass bottle preparations in Advanced Preparations require additional equipment and technique. Blood essence work in Blood Essence Mastery demands expertise with both previous series plus access to expensive materials. Build competence methodically.

I spent five years working exclusively with field formulations before attempting advanced preparations. You don't need five years, but you do need consistent success with basics before progressing. Your materials budget will thank you.
## Final Thoughts
Alchemy combines art, science, and practical experimentation. These formulas represent decades of refinement by multiple practitioners. They work reliably when prepared correctly. Your job is learning correct preparation through careful practice.

Don't be discouraged by early failures. Every accomplished alchemist has destroyed batches, wasted materials, and created unintended effects. The difference between competence and incompetence is learning from those failures rather than repeating them indefinitely.

Start with Fire Resistance Brew. Simple ingredients, forgiving process, useful result. Build confidence with successful preparation before tackling more complex formulations.

Good luck. Try not to set anything on fire that you didn't intend to ignite.
