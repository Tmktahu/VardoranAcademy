## How I Learned This Formula
The Academy contracted with the Ashen Keep for monster parts throughout the AD 30s. Reliable suppliers are rare, and monster hunters who actually survive long enough to deliver materials are rarer still. When their lead huntmaster, a woman named Mira Ashworth, visited to negotiate terms, I asked about their methods.

"How do you survive?" I asked. "Monster hunting is notoriously lethal."

She pulled out a waterskin. "We drink this before every hunt. Makes us hit harder. Gives us edge we need."

I expected elaborate preparation involving rare materials and complex technique. Instead, she described the simplest combat brew I'd ever encountered: hell's clarion mushrooms, fish bone, and water. That's it. No heating, no distillation, just grind and mix.

I was skeptical until she offered me a dose before sparring demonstration. The effect was immediate and undeniable. My strikes had noticeably more force behind them. This was practical field alchemy at its finest, meaning no fancy equipment required, just results.

Mira shared the formula freely. "Knowledge that saves lives shouldn't be hoarded," she said. I've included it in Academy records because she's right.
## The Formula
**Ingredients:**
- 32 measures hell's clarion (fresh or dried works equally)
- 1 fish bone (any fish species)
- 1 empty waterskin

**Preparation:**
Grind hell's clarion mushrooms thoroughly. The red glow fades during grinding, which is normal. Add fish bone and grind together until bone becomes powder. The bone provides calcium compounds that stabilize hell's clarion's aggressive properties.

Transfer mixture to waterskin. Add clean water to fill. Shake vigorously for one minute, then let steep for 30 minutes minimum. The brew turns deep red with slight orange tint. Strain out solids before drinking.

According to Mira, hunters typically prepare this the night before a hunt and drink it immediately upon encountering prey. The 30-minute steeping ensures full activation.

**Effect:**
One waterskin provides enhanced physical power throughout the day. Your strikes hit noticeably harder than normal. The effect manifests as slight warmth in muscles and heightened aggressive impulses, so control these impulses or you'll waste energy on reckless attacks.
## Practical Uses
Monster hunting represents the obvious application. Increased striking power makes the difference between wounding prey and actually killing it. Ashen Keep hunters consider this brew mandatory equipment.

Military forces have adopted the formula for shock troops and frontline combatants. Any situation requiring maximum physical impact benefits from enhanced strength.

Arena fighters use it frequently, though some competitions ban it as unfair advantage. Mira's response: "Combat isn't fair. Preparing properly isn't cheating."

The brew also sees use in non-combat applications requiring physical strength: heavy construction, emergency debris removal, situations where brute force solves problems.
## What the Hunters Taught Me
The Ashen Keep's approach to alchemy differs fundamentally from Academy methods. We theorize, they test. We seek to understand mechanisms, they seek to survive encounters.

Mira explained their development process: "We tried every mushroom we found. Most did nothing. Some killed test subjects. Hell's clarion made survivors hit harder, so we kept using it. The fish bone came later because someone noticed the brew made them angry and tried adding different things until they found something that mellowed the rage without losing the strength."

This is empirical alchemy stripped to basics. No theory, no mechanism understanding, just controlled experimentation and practical results. It works because extensive field testing proves it works, not because anyone understands why.

I've attempted to determine the actual mechanism. Hell's clarion's chaos properties clearly provide the strength enhancement. The fish bone's role remains unclear beyond "it makes the brew less likely to turn you into raging idiot." Sometimes that's sufficient explanation.
## Important Warnings
The heightened aggression is real. Mira warns against drinking this during tense negotiations or anywhere you need diplomatic restraint. The brew makes violence feel like better solution than it actually is.

Don't use this for marathon physical labor. The enhancement works well for extended activities but isn't meant for days of continuous exertion. The enhanced strength comes with enhanced exhaustion afterward.

Hell's clarion from different regions varies in potency. Ashen Keep hunters use Dunley cavern mushrooms exclusively. If sourcing from elsewhere, you may need to adjust quantities through testing.

Fresh preparation works better than stored brew. Mix it the night before use, not days in advance. The fish bone compounds degrade in aqueous solution, reducing stabilizing effects over time.
